The total drainage area studied is\napproximately 8.6 square miles.\n\n\nExisting drainage in the Town reflects open channel drainageways in\ncombination with storm sewer conveyance for more urbanized areas. Most\nof the Town's existing drainage infrastructure is undersized due to the\nincrease in development within the Town during the 1990s. The existing\nconveyance system has the capacity to convey nuisance flows, but it does\nnot have the capacity to convey even the minor (5-year) storm events.\n\n\n2.2 Land use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe study area watershed is comprised of a combination of Hydrologic\nSoil Group (HSG) A, B, C, and D soils as classified by the Natural\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS). These soil types are very\nintermixed with HSG A soils (i.e. soils with increased hydrologic\nconductivity) covering areas such as downtown locations, and north-south\nalong the eastern basin limits. HSG B soils cover the least area in the\nwatershed, with locations predominately along Saint Vrain Creek, and\nnorth and south branches. HSG C soils are represented along a\nnorth-south plane, along the easternmost portions of the watershed.\nFinally, HSG D soils (i.e. soils with the least potential for hydrologic\nconductivity) represent the greatest are of the watershed and are\npredominately located towards the northern and western watershed limits,\ncovering rock outcrops and other less permeable sources. A soil map of\nthe watershed can be found in \nAppendix B.\n\n\nIt should be noted that for the study area, the HSG A soils are\ncolluvial land type soil. According to the colluvial land soil\ndescription, the depth to restrictive feature is 2 to 60 inches to\nlithic bedrock.

            "text": "3.0 Hydrologic Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\n3.1 Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor this study, a new hydrologic model was prepared for the Town of\nLyons. This purpose of this model was to develop updated hydrology for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year storm frequencies for both existing\nand future imperviousness. Similar to the 1998 BRW study, the UDFCD's\nColorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) was used to develop runoff\nhydrographs for each sub-basin in the study. However, with the recent\nrelease of CUHP v2.0 by the UDFCD, and that Lyons is located outside of\nthe UDFCD boundary, further investigations were made to confirm the\napplicability of the new CUHP software in comparison to other hydrologic\nmethods. The selection of the hydrologic model is discussed below.\n\n\n3.2 Hydrologic Model\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo evaluate the latest version of CUHP (and other hydrologic methods)\nand to determine the appropriate model inputs, a peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis was conducted for a typical undeveloped sub-basin near the\nTown, using various hydrologic techniques. The following lists the\nhydrologic methods that were reviewed in the sensitivity analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Geologic Survey (USGS) Regional Regression Equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRational Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUHP 2005 Version 1.4.4 -- This is the more recent model used by\n    UDFCD (prior to the recent update) and has been used for over 40\n    years to estimate peak flows in the Denver metropolitan area and\n    front range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUHP Version 2.0 -- Recently the UDFCD has determined that peak\n    flows developed in recent hydrologic studies using CUHP 2005 version\n    1.4.4 deviated from statistical stream gage analysis across the\n    District and created uncertainty with CUHP model results for\n    some studies. Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods. Further documentation on\nthe hydrologic model recommendations can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\n3.3 Design Rainfall\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe design rainfall for the project was derived using the one-hour\nprecipitation depths from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) Atlas 14. One-hour point precipitation depths were\nbased on the centroid of the entire project area and were recorded for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year recurrence intervals. Point\nprecipitation depths for varying elevation within the project area were\nidentified, but point precipitation depth adjustments due to elevation\nwere not necessary since the difference in the one-hour precipitation\ndepths by elevation was less than 0.1 inches. Using the one-hour\nprecipitation depth, CUHP calculates the incremental depth for each time\nincrement from 5 to 120 minutes. Due to the smaller sizes of sub-basins,\nprecipitation depth-area reduction factors were not utilized. Table 3-1\nsummarizes the design rainfall depths for various recurrence intervals.\n\n\nTable 3-1: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Period\n\n\n\n\n1-Hr Rainfall Depth (in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-yr\n\n\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Sub-basin Characteristics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basin characteristics for each basin are further described below and\ncan be found in \nAppendix B.\n\n\n3.4.1 Sub-basin Delineation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basins were delineated using the 2011 LIDAR and associated 1-ft\ncontours. There is a total of 44 sub-basins within the project area. The\nundeveloped sub-basins located higher up in the watersheds are larger in\nsize than the sub-basins within the urbanized Town. Sub-basin sizes\nrange from 17 acres to 335 acres. Figure 1 provides an overview of the\nsub-basins.\n\n\n3.4.2 Length, Centroid Distance, Slope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCUHP parameters such as sub-basin length, distance to centroid, and\nslopes were derived for each sub-basin using topographic data. Slopes\nwere computed using the length-weighted, corrected average slope from\nUDFCD's Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM), including\ncorrections for stream and vegetated channels. Further information on\nthese corrections can be found in \nAppendix B.\n\n\n3.4.3 Depression Losses\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe maximum pervious depression storage was set to the recommended value\nof 0.4 inches for wooded areas and open fields. The maximum impervious\ndepression storage was set to the recommended value of 0.1 inches. No\nadjustments were made to these recommended values.\n\n\n3.4.4 Infiltration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSoils data was obtained from USDA NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database\nfor the project area which classified the soils into Hydrologic Soils\nGroups (HSGs). Additional soils mapping was obtained from the USDA NRCS\nWeb Soil Survey. This information is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nThe initial rate, final rate, and decay coefficient for the Horton's\ninfiltration parameters were based on the recommended values in the\nUSDCM. The Horton's infiltration parameters were weighted based on the\npercentage of each soil type within each sub-basin. Table 3-2 summarizes\nthe Horton's infiltration parameters utilized in the analysis.\n\n\nTable 3-2: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInfiltration (inches per hour)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrologic Soil Group\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInitial - fi\n\n\n\n\nFinal - fo\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDecay Coefficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA/B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 CUHP Output\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe hydrologic analysis was conducted for both existing conditions and\nfuture conditions land use. The 100-year peak discharges from CUHP v2.0\nfor both conditions are presented in Table 3-3. CUHP output for other\nrecurrence intervals is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nAlthough this hydrologic analysis did not calibrate peak flows to the\nprevious Town of Lyons Drainage Master Plan Final Report prepared by\nBRW, the CUHP unit rates of runoff were compared with the previous study\nunit rates of runoff for sub-basins that were similarly delineated. In\nsome cases, the unit rates of runoff are similar, but there are cases\nwhere the unit rates of runoff differ. These differences are primarily\ndue to physical differences in input assumptions (imperviousness, HSGs,\netc.).\n\n\nTable 3-3: CUHP Output, 100-Year\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubbasin\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n401\n\n\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n2.57\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n2.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n\n\n2.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n387\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n387\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n375\n\n\n\n\n2.32\n\n\n\n\n386\n\n\n\n\n2.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n367\n\n\n\n\n1.62\n\n\n\n\n373\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n531\n\n\n\n\n2.52\n\n\n\n\n599\n\n\n\n\n2.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n\n\n143\n\n\n\n\n1.96\n\n\n\n\n145\n\n\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n313\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n313\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Hydrograph Routing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA hydrograph routing network was developed based on field\nreconnaissance, survey of the existing storm sewer network within Town,\nand the BRW, Inc. drainage master plan using EPA SWMM. The routing\nnetwork in EPA SWMM includes: nodes (junctions and dividers), conduits\n(including overflow or diverted links), storage units, storage outlets,\nand outfalls. The model input parameters for nodes include: node\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum node depth, and overflow or\ndiverted link identifier. Input parameters for conduits include: conduit\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, shape (e.g.\ntrapezoidal, circular, rectangular, etc.), length, bottom width, side\nslopes, roughness coefficient, number of barrels, and inlet/outlet\noffset depths. Input parameters for storage units include: storage unit\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum depth, and a stage-area\nrelationship. Input parameters for storage outlets include: outlet\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, and a\nstage-discharge relationship. Input parameters for outfalls include the\noutfall identifier and invert elevation. Input parameters for the SWMM\nmodel are provided in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 SWMM Node Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNode identifiers in SWMM are synonymous with the sub-basin IDs. Invert\nelevations were determined using the 2011 LIDAR data. In some instances,\na divider was used to allow the flow to be routed through the existing\nstorm sewer system but when the capacity of the storm sewer is exceeded,\nthe water overflows into the street (along 2nd Avenue south of E. Main\nStreet and near the intersection of Main Street and E. Main Street).\n\n\n3.5.2 SWMM Conduit Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor the drainage basins located outside of Town, transects of the\ndrainage channels were generated using the 2011 LIDAR and a\nrepresentative channel cross-section was input into the SWMM model. The\nmanning's roughness coefficient for these undeveloped drainage basins\nwas estimated to be 0.035 to represent channels with some weeds and\nstones.\n\n\nWithin the developed areas, characteristics of the drainage facilities\nwere based on survey of the existing storm sewer system, field\nreconnaissance, and sizing the channels so that the flow could\nadequately be conveyed to the outfall. Between 5th Avenue and 4th\nAvenue, there is an existing drainage ditch that varies in width and\ndepth but is enclosed downstream to accommodate development over the\nditch. For the purposes of the SWMM model, it was assumed to have a\nuniform width and depth. There is a small roadside swale with\nintermittent driveway and roadway culverts along the west side of 3rd\nAvenue. However, the swale and culverts have such limited capacity and\nduring large storm events, the water would flow down 3rd Avenue. At 3rd\nAvenue and Main Street there is a 30\" reinforced concrete pipe that\ndiverts flow from 3rd Avenue to the southeast along E. Main Street.\nDuring large storm events, the flow continues down within E. Main\nStreet, which was modeled as an open channel, until it discharges into\nthe St. Vrain Creek. South of E. Main Street along 2nd Avenue there is a\nstorm sewer system consisting of 18-inch, 12-inch, and 15-inch\ncorrugated metal pipe which discharges into the St. Vrain Creek. This\nstorm sewer system was modeled as a 12-inch pipe in the SWMM model.\n\n\nThere are many sub-basins which are direct flow areas into the North St.\nVrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, or St. Vrain Creek. Therefore, the\nconduits for these sub-basins were modeled as \"dummy\" conduits.\n\n\n3.5.3 SWMM Storage Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn existing detention pond is located within Sub-basin 1.5.

The following lists the\nhydrologic methods that were reviewed in the sensitivity analysis:    United States Geologic Survey (USGS) Regional Regression Equations.    Rational Method.    CUHP 2005 Version 1.4.4 -- This is the more recent model used by\n    UDFCD (prior to the recent update) and has been used for over 40\n    years to estimate peak flows in the Denver metropolitan area and\n    front range.    CUHP Version 2.0 -- Recently the UDFCD has determined that peak\n    flows developed in recent hydrologic studies using CUHP 2005 version\n    1.4.4 deviated from statistical stream gage analysis across the\n    District and created uncertainty with CUHP model results for\n    some studies. Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.    HEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.    UDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.    Based on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods.
