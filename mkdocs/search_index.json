A fully executed agreement was\nreceived by ICON Engineering Inc. on March 28, 2016. This study was\nsupported by the grant funding from the Community Development Block\nGrant Disaster Recovery program.\n\n\n1.2 Purpose and Scope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStormwater Master Plans are commonly used by local and regional\ngovernments in a manner similar to land use, parks, or other master\nplans. These plans become part of the local community's comprehensive\nand capital improvement plans. Stormwater master plans help community\nleaders, planners, and engineers work with developers and private land\nowners. Stormwater drainage is unaffected by administrative or paper\nboundaries and a stormwater master plan helps all parties understand the\nnatural conditions, constraints, and opportunities to manage stormwater\nin a safe, compliant, and sustainable manner. Like most master plans,\nthis report provides the Town a starting point for ensuring the public\nsafety and welfare of its citizens, businesses, and visitors.\n\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive stormwater\nmaster plan for the Town of Lyons. The focus of the study is to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantify stormwater runoff and quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify potential flood hazards and problem areas for subbasins\n    tributary to North St. Vrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, and St.\n    Vrain Creek, as they flow through the Town\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and prioritize capital improvement projects to reduce flood\n    frequency and flood risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended improvement to enhance water quality and meet other\n    sustainable objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a guide for increasing stormwater resilience within the Town\n    of Lyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original drainage master plan for the Town of Lyons was completed by\nBRW, Inc. in 1998.

This\nStormwater Master Plan utilizes current topographic, property, and\nengineering data collected between 2013 and 2016. Like its predecessor,\nthis report is likely to serve the community for many years to come.\n\n\nThis study initially identified and inventoried stormwater\ninfrastructure throughout town. A geospatial database of over 250\nfeatures was collected and is being incorporated into the Town's larger\nGIS inventory. From that point, hydrologic analysis was completed to\ndetermine the range of stormwater runoff from each of the Town's\ndrainage basins. A hydraulic analysis used the stormwater runoff values\nto model how the surface waters drained through town. The existing storm\nsewer system was evaluated to determine how capture and conveyance\nsystems operated during the various design storms. The resulting flood\ndepth maps were used to identify or confirm problem areas and structures\nat risk of flood damages. Alternative solutions to mitigate the\npotential damages were developed. Each alternative was considered for\nresulting benefits (i.e. averted damages) and costs.

The total drainage area studied is\napproximately 8.6 square miles.\n\n\nExisting drainage in the Town reflects open channel drainageways in\ncombination with storm sewer conveyance for more urbanized areas. Most\nof the Town's existing drainage infrastructure is undersized due to the\nincrease in development within the Town during the 1990s. The existing\nconveyance system has the capacity to convey nuisance flows, but it does\nnot have the capacity to convey even the minor (5-year) storm events.\n\n\nAt the time of this report, there are current requests for study and\nanalysis of potential annexation areas adjacent to the current town\nlimits. These areas were identified for study after the completion of\nthe stormwater inventory and hydrologic analysis. However, this study\nhas provided some limited information relative to adjacent areas.\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2-1: Watersheds Map\n\n\n2.2 Land Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe study area watershed is comprised of a combination of Hydrologic\nSoil Group (HSG) A, B, C, and D soils as classified by the Natural\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS). These soil types are very\nintermixed with HSG A soils (i.e. soils with increased hydrologic\nconductivity) covering areas such as downtown locations, and north-south\nalong the eastern basin limits. HSG B soils cover the least area in the\nwatershed, with locations predominately along Saint Vrain Creek, and\nnorth and south branches. HSG C soils are represented along a\nnorth-south plane, along the easternmost portions of the watershed.\nFinally, HSG D soils (i.e. soils with the least potential for hydrologic\nconductivity) represent the greatest are of the watershed and are\npredominately located towards the northern and western watershed limits,\ncovering rock outcrops and other less permeable sources.\n\n\nIt should be noted that for the study area, the HSG A soils are\ncolluvial land type soil. According to the colluvial land soil\ndescription, the depth to restrictive feature is 2 to 60 inches to\nlithic bedrock. Because of the underlying bedrock, it was assumed that\nthe HSG A soils would have the drainage characteristics of HSG B soils.\n\n\nLand use was determined by compiling information from the 2009 Zoning\nDistrict Map, 2010 Lyons Planning Area Map, and by ground-truthing the\nland cover based on an October 2015 aerial image of the watershed. Each\nland use category was assigned a percent imperviousness with guidance\nfrom Chapter 6 \u2013 Runoff of the UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage Criteria\nManual. Table 2-1 outlines the land use categories and the corresponding\npercent imperviousness. In addition to the land use categories found in\nTable 2-1, Boulder County Open Space land use represented a significant\nportion of the watershed. Table 2-2 displays the soil types used to\ncalculate imperviousness for the Boulder County Open Space land use\ncategory.\n\n\nTable 2-1: Land Use Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Use Category\n\n\n\n\nUDFCD Equivalent\n\n\n\n\nImperviousness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\nUndeveloped: Greenbelts, agricultural\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\nBusiness: Downtown areas\n\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPark\n\n\n\n\nParks, cemeteries\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMunicipal Facilities\n\n\n\n\nBusiness: Suburban areas\n\n\n\n\n75%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstate Residential\n\n\n\n\nResidential: Single Family: 2.5 acres or larger\n\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Density Residential\n\n\n\n\nResidential: Single Family: 0.25-0.75 acres\n\n\n\n\n75%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium Density Residential\n\n\n\n\nResidential: Single Family: 0.75-2.5 acres\n\n\n\n\n85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\n\n\n\nBusiness: Downtown areas\n\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Area\n\n\n\n\nBusiness: Downtown areas\n\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Entertainment\n\n\n\n\nBusiness: Downtown areas\n\n\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Industrial\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial: Light areas\n\n\n\n\n80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Industrial\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial: Heavy areas\n\n\n\n\n90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2-2: Soil Types Found in Boulder County Open Space Land Use Category\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil Unit\n\n\n\n\nHSG\n\n\n\n\nSoil Type\n\n\n\n\nDrainage Class\n\n\n\n\nRunoff Class\n\n\n\n\nRock Outcrop\n\n\n\n\nImperviousness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMdB\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nsandy loam\n\n\n\n\nwell\n\n\n\n\nvery low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNh\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\n\nloam\n\n\n\n\npoorly\n\n\n\n\nvery low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCu\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\ngravelly sandy loam\n\n\n\n\nexcessively\n\n\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNnB\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nsandy clay loam\n\n\n\n\nwell\n\n\n\n\nmedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmF\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nstony loam\n\n\n\n\nwell\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaF\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\nvery stony sandy loam\n\n\n\n\nwell\n\n\n\n\nvery high\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrF\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\nvery stony loamy fine sand\n\n\n\n\nwell\n\n\n\n\nvery high\n\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRo\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\nunweathered bedrock\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nvery high\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that land use category corresponds to the 2010 Lyons\nPlanning Area Map.

The drainage path for the watershed is a\nsteep mountain channel with an approximate slope between 5% and 35%. The\nchannel flows south before turning east near Eagle Canyon Subdivision\nbefore draining into the North St. Vrain Creek. The watershed ranges in\nelevation from 6670 feet to 5390 feet. The majority of the watershed is\nundeveloped or large lot residential with the exception of the Eagle\nCanyon Subdivision. The Eagle Canyon Subdivision drains to the southeast\ninto an existing detention basin.\n\n\n2.3.2 Eastern Lyons\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Eastern Lyons Watershed is generally bounded by 2\nnd\n\nAvenue to the west and Stone Canyon Watershed to the east. The watershed\nranges in elevation from 5850 feet to 5300 feet. The 87 acre watershed\nconveys flow southwest to the 2\nnd\n Avenue and Main Street\nintersection. An existing storm drain intercepts flow from the new\ndevelopment along 1\nst\n Avenue discharging onto the street on\n2\nnd\n Avenue. Flow within the Eastern Lyons Watershed is\nconveyed along the east side of 2\nnd\n Avenue in a small\nroadside swale. Any flows exceeding the capacity of this swale that\novertop 2\nnd\n Avenue have the possibility of spilling into the\nThird Avenue Watershed. A small, 18-inch, storm drain intercepts minor\nflows north of Main Street and conveys flow through the shopping center\nalong Main Street. The storm drain crosses Main Street discharging into\nan open channel in the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed before\ndischarging into St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\nDuring the course of this study, the Colorado Department of\nTransportation initiated a roadway and storm drainage improvements along\nMain Street in the vicinity of 2\nnd\n Avenue. The as-built\ndocuments were not available at the time of the hydraulic analysis, but\nan estimated version of the storm drain system in that area was used in\nthe study.\n\n\n2.3.3 Ewald Ave\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Ewald Avenue Watershed originates southwest of the North and South\nSt. Vrain Creek confluence. The 160 acre watershed ranges in elevation\nfrom 5875 feet to 5320 feet. Unlike the other major watersheds, the\nEwald Avenue Watershed does not have a defined channel flow path. The\nrunoff from this watershed is primarily sheet flow along the steep\nhillsides northeast towards the residential developments. The only storm\ndrain infrastructure within the watershed is a 48 inch reinforced\nconcrete pipe installed along Park Street from 4\nth\n Avenue to\nNorth St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.4 Lyons Valley Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLocated south of St. Vrain Creek, the Lyons Valley Park Watershed is\nprimarily medium residential lots. The watershed ranges in elevation\nfrom 5860 feet to 5260 feet. The runoff from the 210 acre watershed is\nconveyed northeast through the subdivision to St. Vrain Creek. There is\nno defined flow path through the watershed as flow is primarily conveyed\ndown McConnell Drive. There is an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm\ndrain system on Bohn Court, Noland Court, and Estes Court. Curb side\ncombination inlets capture stormwater in these areas. The system is\nupsized to a 30-inch reinforced concrete pipe at McConnell Drive before\nthe flow is discharged into the St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.5 North St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe North St. Vrain Creek Watershed is a combination of several\nsubwatersheds that are directly tributary to North St. Vrain Creek.\nThere are both left and right bank tributaries with subwatersheds\nranging in size from 20 acres to 190 acres. The watersheds vary in land\nuse including dense residential, commercial, open space, and undeveloped\nareas.\n\n\n2.3.6 Red Hill Gulch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Red Hill Gulch Watershed is located on the south side of the St.\nVrain Creek ranging in elevation from 6800 feet to 5300 feet. The runoff\nfrom this 1560 acre watershed is conveyed in the upper reaches by an\nopen channel with an average slope of 5 to 20 percent. The channel\ngenerally follows Red Gulch Road north before flows are intercepted by\nSouth Ledge Ditch. Any flows exceeding the capacity of the South Ledge\nDitch will overtop the ditch and continue north. Due to the limited\ncapacity of the irrigation ditch, major storm events have the\npossibility of conveying a large volume of water north into Bohn Park\nand Lyons Valley Park Subdivision.\n\n\n2.3.7 South St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe South St. Vrain Creek is a combination of several subwatersheds that\nare directly tributary to South St. Vrain Creek. These subwatersheds are\nboth left and right bank tributaries to the South St. Vrain Creek\nranging in size from 70 acres to 210 acres. The development throughout\nthe watershed varies from undeveloped to large lot residential.\n\n\n2.3.8 South 2nd Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed is bounded by 3\nrd\n\nAvenue to the west, Main Street to the north and east and the St. Vrain\nCreek to the south. The approximately 20 acre watershed drains southeast\nranging in elevation from 5360 feet to 5310 feet. A combination 24-inch\nstorm drain and open channel system conveys flow along the south side of\nMain Street discharging into St. Vrain Creek. An 18-inch storm drain\nconveys flow south from the Park Street and 2\nnd\n Avenue\nintersection into St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.9 Steamboat Valley\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Steamboat Valley watershed is located directly north of downtown,\nbounded by the Eagle Canyon Watershed to the west and to the east by the\nThird Avenue and Stone Canyon Watersheds. The majority of the 370 acre\nwatershed converges just upstream of downtown and is conveyed between\n4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Avenue. In the upper reaches, the\nwatershed consists of large lot residential and undeveloped properties.\nThe lower third of the watershed is fully developed consisting of\nresidential and commercial lots. In the lower downtown area the\nwatershed is bounded by 4\nth\n Avenue to the east and North St.\nVrain Creek to the west. The watershed ranges in elevation from 6520\nfeet to 5335 feet.\n\n\nThe flow concentrates in the upper reaches in an open channel with an\napproximate slope of XXX. The flow continues south into a private\ninadvertent storage area on the Russell property upstream of the old\nrailroad embankment. Downstream of the railroad embankment the\ndrainageway is confined in a small open channel that conveys flow\nthrough backyards of private property. There are several roadway\ncrossings within this reach including Vasquez Road, McCall Alley, Reese\nAvenue, Steward Avenue, and Stickney Avenue. A reportedly historic stone\nbox culvert intercepts flow and conveys flow underneath downtown until\nthe outfall location into North St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\nAn 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe collects flow along\n5\nth\n Street south of Main Street to Park Drive. This pipe\nincreases in size just downstream of Park Drive to a 28-inch by 16-inch\nreinforced concrete elliptical pipe before discharging to North St.\nVrain Creek.\n\n\nAlong 4\nth\n Avenue an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain\npipe intercepts flow at Stickney Avenue and conveys the flow south to\nRailroad Avenue. At Railroad Avenue the storm drain increases in size to\na 24-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe continuing south to the\noutfall location into North St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.10 Stone Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Stone Canyon Watershed is located east of the Third Avenue and\nEastern Lyons Watersheds. In the upper reaches, the 1550 acre watershed\nis dominated by large residential and undeveloped properties. The open\nchannel which conveys the majority of the runoff for the Stone Canyon\nwatershed has an average slope of XXX. The watershed ranges in elevation\nfrom 6580 feet to 5294 feet.\n\n\nThe open channel drainageway passes through multiple roadway crossings\nwithin Boulder County. Within the Town of Lyons, Stone Canyon is\nconveyed underneath Stone Canyon Road through a 13 foot by 8 foot\nreinforced concrete box culvert. The drainage path continues south where\nflow is conveyed underneath Ute Highway through an 8 foot by 4 foot\nreinforced concrete box culvert into St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.11 Third Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Third Avenue watershed, approximately 170 acres, conveys flow\nsouthwest into the downtown area along Third Avenue. The watershed is\nundeveloped upstream of the downtown area bounded by Steamboat Valley to\nthe west and Eastern Lyons and Stone Canyon. The watershed ranges in\nelevation from 6260 feet to 5320 feet. Development within the lower\nportions of the watershed is dominated by residential and commercial\ndevelopment. The watershed discharges flow into North St. Vrain Creek\njust upstream of the confluence with South St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\nAn existing 5 foot x 4 foot elliptical pipe conveys flow underneath Main\nStreet at Third Avenue into the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed.",

Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods. Further documentation on\nthe hydrologic model recommendations can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\n3.3 Design Rainfall\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe design rainfall for the project was derived using the one-hour\nprecipitation depths from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) Atlas 14. One-hour point precipitation depths were\nbased on the centroid of the entire project area and were recorded for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year recurrence intervals. Point\nprecipitation depths for varying elevation within the project area were\nidentified, but point precipitation depth adjustments due to elevation\nwere not necessary since the difference in the one-hour precipitation\ndepths by elevation was less than 0.1 inches. Using the one-hour\nprecipitation depth, CUHP calculates the incremental depth for each time\nincrement from 5 to 120 minutes. Due to the smaller sizes of sub-basins,\nprecipitation depth-area reduction factors were not utilized. Table 3-1\nsummarizes the design rainfall depths for various recurrence intervals.\n\n\nTable 3-1: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Period\n\n\n\n\n1-Hr Rainfall Depth (in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-yr\n\n\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Sub-basin Characteristics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basin characteristics for each basin are further described below and\ncan be found in \nAppendix A\n.\n\n\n3.4.1 Sub-basin Delineation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basins were delineated using the 2011 LIDAR and associated 1-ft\ncontours. There is a total of 44 sub-basins within the project area. The\nundeveloped sub-basins located higher up in the watersheds are larger in\nsize than the sub-basins within the urbanized Town. Sub-basin sizes\nrange from 17 acres to 335 acres. \nAppendix A\n provides an overview of\nthe sub-basins.\n\n\n3.4.2 Length, Centroid Distance, Slope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCUHP parameters such as sub-basin length, distance to centroid, and\nslopes were derived for each sub-basin using topographic data. Slopes\nwere computed using the length-weighted, corrected average slope from\nUDFCD's Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM), including\ncorrections for stream and vegetated channels.\n\n\n3.4.3 Depression Losses\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe maximum pervious depression storage was set to the recommended value\nof 0.4 inches for wooded areas and open fields. The maximum impervious\ndepression storage was set to the recommended value of 0.1 inches. No\nadjustments were made to these recommended values.\n\n\n3.4.4 Infiltration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSoils data was obtained from USDA NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database\nfor the project area which classified the soils into Hydrologic Soils\nGroups (HSGs). Additional soils mapping was obtained from the USDA NRCS\nWeb Soil Survey. This information is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nThe initial rate, final rate, and decay coefficient for the Horton's\ninfiltration parameters were based on the recommended values in the\nUSDCM. The Horton's infiltration parameters were weighted based on the\npercentage of each soil type within each sub-basin. Table 3-2 summarizes\nthe Horton's infiltration parameters utilized in the analysis.\n\n\nTable 3-2: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInfiltration (inches per hour)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrologic Soil Group\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInitial - fi\n\n\n\n\nFinal - fo\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDecay Coefficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA/B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 CUHP Output\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe hydrologic analysis was conducted for both existing conditions and\nfuture conditions land use. The 100-year peak discharges from CUHP v2.0\nfor both conditions are presented in Table 3-3. CUHP output for other\nrecurrence intervals is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nAlthough this hydrologic analysis did not calibrate peak flows to the\nprevious Town of Lyons Drainage Master Plan Final Report prepared by\nBRW, the CUHP unit rates of runoff were compared with the previous study\nunit rates of runoff for sub-basins that were similarly delineated. In\nsome cases, the unit rates of runoff are similar, but there are cases\nwhere the unit rates of runoff differ. These differences are primarily\ndue to physical differences in input assumptions (imperviousness, HSGs,\netc.).\n\n\nTable 3-3: CUHP Output, 100-Year\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubbasin\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n2.57\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\n2.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n\n\n2.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n387\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n387\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n375\n\n\n\n\n2.32\n\n\n\n\n386\n\n\n\n\n2.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n367\n\n\n\n\n1.62\n\n\n\n\n373\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n531\n\n\n\n\n2.52\n\n\n\n\n599\n\n\n\n\n2.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n\n\n360\n\n\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n\n\n143\n\n\n\n\n1.96\n\n\n\n\n145\n\n\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n313\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n313\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Hydrograph Routing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA hydrograph routing network was developed based on field\nreconnaissance, survey of the existing storm sewer network within Town,\nand the BRW, Inc. drainage master plan using EPA SWMM. The routing\nnetwork in EPA SWMM includes: nodes (junctions and dividers), conduits\n(including overflow or diverted links), storage units, storage outlets,\nand outfalls. The model input parameters for nodes include: node\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum node depth, and overflow or\ndiverted link identifier. Input parameters for conduits include: conduit\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, shape (e.g.\ntrapezoidal, circular, rectangular, etc.), length, bottom width, side\nslopes, roughness coefficient, number of barrels, and inlet/outlet\noffset depths. Input parameters for storage units include: storage unit\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum depth, and a stage-area\nrelationship. Input parameters for storage outlets include: outlet\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, and a\nstage-discharge relationship. Input parameters for outfalls include the\noutfall identifier and invert elevation. Input parameters for the SWMM\nmodel are provided in Appendix B.\n\n\n3.5.1 SWMM Node Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNode identifiers in SWMM are synonymous with the sub-basin IDs. Invert\nelevations were determined using the 2011 LIDAR data. In some instances,\na divider was used to allow the flow to be routed through the existing\nstorm sewer system but when the capacity of the storm sewer is exceeded,\nthe water overflows into the street (along 2nd Avenue south of E. Main\nStreet and near the intersection of Main Street and E. Main Street).\n\n\n3.5.2 SWMM Conduit Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor the drainage basins located outside of Town, transects of the\ndrainage channels were generated using the 2011 LIDAR and a\nrepresentative channel cross-section was input into the SWMM model. The\nmanning's roughness coefficient for these undeveloped drainage basins\nwas estimated to be 0.035 to represent channels with some weeds and\nstones.\n\n\nWithin the developed areas, characteristics of the drainage facilities\nwere based on survey of the existing storm sewer system, field\nreconnaissance, and sizing the channels so that the flow could\nadequately be conveyed to the outfall. Between 5th Avenue and 4th\nAvenue, there is an existing drainage ditch that varies in width and\ndepth but is enclosed downstream to accommodate development over the\nditch. For the purposes of the SWMM model, it was assumed to have a\nuniform width and depth. There is a small roadside swale with\nintermittent driveway and roadway culverts along the west side of 3rd\nAvenue. However, the swale and culverts have such limited capacity and\nduring large storm events, the water would flow down 3rd Avenue. At 3rd\nAvenue and Main Street there is a 30\" reinforced concrete pipe that\ndiverts flow from 3rd Avenue to the southeast along E. Main Street.\nDuring large storm events, the flow continues down within E. Main\nStreet, which was modeled as an open channel, until it discharges into\nthe St. Vrain Creek. South of E. Main Street along 2nd Avenue there is a\nstorm sewer system consisting of 18-inch, 12-inch, and 15-inch\ncorrugated metal pipe which discharges into the St. Vrain Creek. This\nstorm sewer system was modeled as a 12-inch pipe in the SWMM model.\n\n\nThere are many sub-basins which are direct flow areas into the North St.\nVrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, or St. Vrain Creek. Therefore, the\nconduits for these sub-basins were modeled as \"dummy\" conduits.\n\n\n3.5.3 SWMM Storage Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn existing detention pond is located within Sub-basin 1.5. The\nstage-area relationship was taken directly from the BRW, Inc. drainage\nmaster plan, as well as the stage-discharge relationship for the outlet.\nNo additional detention ponds were modeled for the existing conditions,\nalthough inadvertent storage and/or privately owned detention may\nelsewhere within the project area.\n\n\n3.5.4 SWMM Output\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe SWMM routing was conducted for both existing conditions and future\nconditions. The 100-year peak discharges at all of the outfalls from the\nSWMM model for both conditions are presented in Table 3-4. SWMM output\nfor other recurrence intervals is provided in \nAppendix J.\n\n\nTable 3-4: SWMM Output, 100-Year\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWMM Outfall Name\n\n\n\n\nRouted Subbasins\n\n\n\n\nReceiving

This purpose of this model was to develop updated hydrology for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year storm frequencies for both existing\nand future imperviousness. Similar to the 1998 BRW study, the UDFCD's\nColorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) was used to develop runoff\nhydrographs for each sub-basin in the study. However, with the recent\nrelease of CUHP v2.0 by the UDFCD, and that Lyons is located outside of\nthe UDFCD boundary, further investigations were made to confirm the\napplicability of the new CUHP software in comparison to other hydrologic\nmethods. The selection of the hydrologic model is discussed below.  A full copy of the Hydrologic study is provided in  Appendix B.",

The following lists the\nhydrologic methods that were reviewed in the sensitivity analysis:    United States Geologic Survey (USGS) Regional Regression Equations.    Rational Method.    CUHP 2005 Version 1.4.4 -- This is the more recent model used by\n    UDFCD (prior to the recent update) and has been used for over 40\n    years to estimate peak flows in the Denver metropolitan area and\n    front range.    CUHP Version 2.0 -- Recently the UDFCD has determined that peak\n    flows developed in recent hydrologic studies using CUHP 2005 version\n    1.4.4 deviated from statistical stream gage analysis across the\n    District and created uncertainty with CUHP model results for\n    some studies. Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.    HEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.    UDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.    Based on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods.

            "text": "4.0 Hydraulic Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\n4.1 Previous Analysis and Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe information provided in the previous 1998 Drainage Master Plan study\nwas used to help identify flood hazards throughout the Town of Lyons.\nThe previous report identifies several key areas as having potential for\nflooding hazards. A few key events are highlighted for reference.\n\n\nIn the August 1994 flood the Ewald Avenue subwatershed was observed to\nproduce enough runoff to carry debris off the hillside onto the\nresidential streets.\n\n\nSteamboat Valley was identified as having the greatest impact to\nflooding throughout the Town of Lyons. The report indicated the\nSteamboat Valley Watershed was the hardest hit area during the 1994\nstorm. The existing storm drain system between 4\nth\n and\n5\nth\n Avenue was estimated to be an approximate 5-year storm\ncapacity. The storage behind the old railroad embankment was identified\nas an issue of major concern. The properties downstream of the railroad\nembankment have grown reliant on this detention and removal of this\ndetention would have negative impacts to downstream property owners.\nSeveral properties behind the railroad embankment were noted to be at\nrisk of flooding when the detention area was full.\n\n\nThe conveyance of Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff in South Ledge Ditch\nwas identified as a possible flooding hazard. The report noted the\npossibility of the ditch embankment to become compromised and the bank\nto be breached with the conveyance of storm water runoff. It should be\nnoted that Lyons Valley Subdivision was not constructed at the time of\nthe previous report.\n\n\nThe 2013 flood event had a well-documented impact on the Town of Lyons.\nThe confluence of the north and south St. Vrain Rivers was the center of\nflood damages during the 2013 floods. Several reports provide further\ndocumentation of the flood event. Numerous post-flood studies on the\nfloodplain and restoration projects are also available.\n\n\nA 2015 flood event was notable because of the hail associated with the\nstorm. The resulting hail-laden runoff clogged surface conveyance\n(streets, gutters) as well as capture systems (inlets, outlet\nstructures).\n\n\n4.2 Evaluation of Existing Facilities\n\uf0c1\n\n\nExisting storm drain infrastructure was evaluated to determine the\napproximate design storm frequency. A summary of existing infrastructure\nis provided in the GIS data provided in \nAppendix K. (or on web map\napplication at www...)\n\n\nFLO-2D software is a two-dimensional flood routing model that was used\nto identify residual flood potential with the watershed. FLO-2D\nsimulates channel flow, unconfined overland flow and street flow over\ncomplex topology. The model uses the full dynamic wave momentum equation\nand a central finite difference routing scheme with eight potential flow\ndirections to predict the progression of a floodwave over a system of\nsquare grid elements. The development of the FLO-2D model is further\ndiscussed below.\n\n\n4.2.1 Flo-2D Model Development\n\uf0c1\n\n\n10-foot by 10-foot grid cells were used to maximize the precision in\nidentifying flooding potential throughout the watershed. Elevations for\neach grid cell were computed through FLO-2D by interpolating the project\nLiDAR data. Building obstructions were incorporated into the FLO-2D\nmodel based on building footprint data that was generated as part of\nthis study.\n\n\nIndividual subwatershed hydrographs were taken from the hydrology model\n(CUHP) and applied to the FLO-2D surface. Each hydrograph was applied at\na single FLO-2D grid cell where the majority of discharges were expected\nto converge for each subwatershed. Existing storm drain systems 24-inch\nand larger were included in the FLO-2D model.\n\n\nSeparate FLO-2D models were used to distinguish the flooding potential\nfor the study area for each of the design storms.\n\n\nThe results of these models are provided in \nAppendix D\n. (And also on\nthe web map at www...)\n\n\n4.3 Flood Hazards\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFLO-2D uses the full dynamic wave momentum equation when computing flow\ndepth at each cell in the study area. This computational methodology\naccounts for floodplain storage at each sump location in the watershed\nattenuating flows as they traverse the watershed downstream. This\nfloodplain storage is not accounted for in the SWMM model which is\ncomputed using a kinematic wave approach. This difference in modeling\napproach leads to discrepancies when comparing design peak flows from\nthe SWMM model and the inundation limits shown in the hydraulic\nanalysis. Existing capacity for each outfall system was estimated from\nnormal depth calculations given each pipe slope. The existing storm\ndrain infrastructure generally lacks the capacity to adequately convey\nthe 5-year storm event.\n\n\nThis is not unusual for a town the age and size of the Town of Lyons.\nLand use regulations and stormwater management policies were not common\nto smaller towns along the Front Range of Colorado until sometime after\nthe 1965 flood on the South Platte River ravaged metro Denver. By the\ntime development regulation and stormwater infrastructure\nrecommendations expanded to include smaller towns along the Front Range,\na lot of Lyons' roadways and private development had encroached on the\nnatural drainageways.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4-1: Problem ID Map\n\n\n4.3.1 Eagle Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most significant flooding hazard in the Eagle Canyon Watershed is\njust upstream of the confluence with North St. Vrain Creek. Development\nimmediately upstream of the confluence has limited the capacity of the\nchannel. By limiting the ability of the channel to convey water to North\nSt. Vrain, the discharge overtops Main Street and spills to the south.\n\n\n4.3.2 Eastern Lyons\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe small swale and private roadway culverts along the east side of\n2\nnd\n Avenue limit the capacity to convey the basin runoff\ndownstream. With no storm drain or curb and gutter system installed\nalong 2\nnd\n Avenue, all basin runoff will flow along\n2\nnd\n Avenue on the street. As mentioned previously, during\nmajor events runoff from the Eastern Lyons watershed any flow\novertopping 2\nnd\n Avenue will flow west and contribute flow to\nthe Third Avenue Watershed.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of Eastern Lyons Watershed the businesses along\nMain Street and residences along Kelling Drive have experienced flooding\nin the past. The only storm drain intercepting flow near the businesses\nis an 18-inch storm drain. This system can capture less than the 5-year\ndesign flow in ideal, free flow, no debris conditions.\n\n\n4.3.3 Ewald Ave\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs noted in the previous study, the steep slopes of the Ewald Ave\nWatershed pose a flooding hazard to the residential development in the\nlower portions of the watershed. The steep slopes in the upper portion\nof the watershed result in high velocities of runoff eroding the\nhillside and carrying debris into the residential development.\n\n\n4.3.4 Lyons Valley Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the Lyons Valley Park Watershed are a result of\ndevelopment within the basin without adequate storm drain conveyance.\nThe 18-inch storm drain throughout the upper reaches of the development\nwas not design to convey major storm events.\n\n\nA significant flooding hazard for the Lyons Valley Park Watershed is\noverflow from the Red Hill Gulch Watershed. The overflow drainage path\nfrom Red Hill Gulch is discussion in further detail below.\n\n\nAn overflow path from the hillside south of the High School is an\ninteresting problem. The modeling scenarios do not account for the\nirrigation ditch that traverses the hillside near the toe of slope. This\nis a common hydraulic modeling assumption to account for a runoff event\nduring a ditch full scenario. However, in a practical sense the\nirrigation ditch catches most minor storm events and effectively\nprotects the adjacent residential structures. At a minimum, the ditch\nshould be monitored for stability to ensure overflows and spills from\nstormwater are handled safely. Additional planning for a time when the\nditch is no longer operational or maintained should be considered.\nFinally, protection or enhancement of the minor swale along the rear lot\nlines of the neighborhood should be considered to ensure sheet flows are\npassed around the structures.\n\n\n4.3.5 North St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the North St. Vrain Watershed are limited to the\nlower end of the basin. Generally flows in this basin concentrate in\nnatural valleys and are conveyed overland towards the St. Vrain River.\n\n\n4.3.6 Red Hill Gulch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most significant flooding hazard in the Red Hill Gulch Watershed is\nflow overtopping the South Ledge Ditch and flow continuing north into\nBohn Park and Lyons Valley Subdivision. Utilizing the ditch for\nintercepting and conveying stormwater runoff creates a significant\nhazard for downstream properties. These comingled flows exceed the\ndesign capacity of the canal jeopardizing the structural integrity of\nthe ditch. Flows overtopping the ditch create an uncontrolled overflow\nimpacting Bohn Park and homes in the Lyons Valley Subdivision.\n\n\n4.3.7 South St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the South St. Vrain Watershed are generally created\nby the lack of a formal drainage conveyance system. The topography\nwithin these watersheds conveys the runoff in separate flow paths to\nSouth St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n4.3.8 South 2nd Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlood hazards within the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed are\ncaused by contributing flow from other watersheds, lack of local runoff\nstorm drain conveyance, and proximity to St. Vrain Creek. The elliptical\npipe underneath Main Street conveys runoff from the Third Avenue\nWatershed to the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed. The pipe\ndischarges flow into an undersized open channel that conveys flow\nsoutheast towards 2\nnd\n Avenue. Any flow that is not\nintercepted by the 24-inch storm drain at 2\nnd\n Avenue spills\nto the south impacting properties. The 18-inch storm drain at\n2\nnd\n Avenue and Park Street intercepts approximately the XX\ndesign flow for the subwatershed, impacting more properties.\n\n\n4.3.9 Steamboat Valley\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most significant flood hazard impacting downtown Lyons is runoff\nfrom Steamboat Valley. The runoff from the upper watershed concentrates\nbehind the old railroad embankment. The area behind the old railroad\nembankment poses a significant flood hazard to downstream properties.\nClose observation on the stability and maintenance of this embankment is\nimportant to managing the risk of a breach or other failure during a\nstorm event. This will require coordination with several private\nproperty owners. Downstream of the railroad embankment development\nwithin the natural drainage path has confined the runoff to an\nundersized open channel through private property. The lack of conveyance\ncapacity of this channel and culvert roadway crossings between\n4\nth\n Avenue and 5\nth\n Avenue creates a flooding\nhazard damaging private property. Any flow that is not intercepted by\nthe historic stone culvert continues on the surface flowing through\nbackyards with additional impact to private property and structures.\n\n\nThe existing conveyance within Steamboat Valley does not have the\nhydraulic capacity to convey storms greater than the 5-year return\nperiod. More importantly, the materials (stone and open channel) and\nalignment (erratic with several sharp bends and constrictions) subjects\nthe adjacent properties to additional risk from debris clogging.\n\n\n4.3.10 Stone Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe steep natural drainageway in the Stone Canyon Watershed conveys the\nrunoff into the open space of the Stone Canyon Subdivision without\nsignificant flood hazards. The roadway crossing at Stone Canyon Road\nconveys the flow downstream without impacting a significant number of\nresidences within the subdivision. Development downstream of Stone\nCanyon Road has eliminated the conveyance capacity of the channel to\nconvey runoff without impacting properties. The water backs up against\nUte Highway as water is conveyed underneath the roadway through the box\nculvert.\n\n\nThere have been reports of soil subsidence in the open space areas\nadjacent to the channel. This study did not include detailed\ngeotechnical analysis to determine a cause or effect of the reported\nsoil movement. More formal identification of the problem areas, formal\nand regular monitoring of those sites, and geotechnical analysis would\nbe required to properly evaluate the risk of those soils relative to\nflood hazards (i.e. bank failure reducing channel capacity), private, or\npublic property.\n\n\n4.3.11 Third Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRunoff from the undeveloped upper watershed enters the downtown in two\ndistinct locations. East of the cemetery flow drains south into the\ndeveloped area of the watershed along Third Avenue. Flow from the\neastern portion of the watershed flows into the downtown area west along\nStickney Avenue before turning south on Third Avenue. The runoff from\nthe watershed continues south along Third Avenue where the majority of\nthe flow is conveyed in the street. The elliptical pipe at Main Street\nconveys flow underneath Main Street into the South 2\nnd\n Avenue\nWatershed. Flows exceeding the capacity of the elliptical pipe split\nwith some flow continuing southeast north of Main Street while some flow\novertops Main Street and continues flowing down Third Street.",

A few key events are highlighted for reference.  In the August 1994 flood the Ewald Avenue subwatershed was observed to\nproduce enough runoff to carry debris off the hillside onto the\nresidential streets.  Steamboat Valley was identified as having the greatest impact to\nflooding throughout the Town of Lyons. The report indicated the\nSteamboat Valley Watershed was the hardest hit area during the 1994\nstorm. The existing storm drain system between 4 th  and\n5 th  Avenue was estimated to be an approximate 5-year storm\ncapacity. The storage behind the old railroad embankment was identified\nas an issue of major concern. The properties downstream of the railroad\nembankment have grown reliant on this detention and removal of this\ndetention would have negative impacts to downstream property owners.\nSeveral properties behind the railroad embankment were noted to be at\nrisk of flooding when the detention area was full.  The conveyance of Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff in South Ledge Ditch\nwas identified as a possible flooding hazard. The report noted the\npossibility of the ditch embankment to become compromised and the bank\nto be breached with the conveyance of storm water runoff. It should be\nnoted that Lyons Valley Subdivision was not constructed at the time of\nthe previous report.  The 2013 flood event had a well-documented impact on the Town of Lyons.\nThe confluence of the north and south St. Vrain Rivers was the center of\nflood damages during the 2013 floods. Several reports provide further\ndocumentation of the flood event. Numerous post-flood studies on the\nfloodplain and restoration projects are also available.  A 2015 flood event was notable because of the hail associated with the\nstorm. The resulting hail-laden runoff clogged surface conveyance\n(streets, gutters) as well as capture systems (inlets, outlet\nstructures).",

The storm drain infrastructure must\nlimit the amount of flow in the street to provide emergency vehicles\naccess during storm events.\n\n\nThe analysis aimed to develop stormwater solutions first within the Town\nof Lyons. When those alternatives were exhausted as cost prohibitive or\nunfeasible, then the project team considered alternatives outside of the\nTown limits. The cost of land acquisition, land use regulations, and\nextra-territorial jurisdiction can add significant costs to stormwater\nprojects outside of the Town limits. Conversely, knowing about potential\nout of town solutions to in-town risks can be prudent to future planning\nexercises in annexation, development referrals, and multi-agency\ncoordination.\n\n\n6.2 Criteria and Constraints\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs noted above, goals for the baseline alternative plan was to provide\nstorm drainage capacity to meeting currently defined drainage criteria\nset forth in the Town of Lyons Storm Drainage System Criteria. The minor\nstorm frequency for the Town of Lyons is the 2-yr design storm with the\n100-yr design storm classified as the major storm frequency.\n\n\n6.3 Evaluation of Detention\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.3.1 Detention\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetention is a common approach to reduce peak flows, optimize pipe size,\nand save on downstream infrastructure costs. Review of the previous\nmaster plan confirmed that previously master planned detention\nfacilities were drafted to meet this goal. If detention is installed in\nthe upper watersheds of the Town, there is a significant cost savings to\ndownstream stormwater infrastructure. However, upon closer examination\nof the previous master plan assumptions, field inspection of the\nproposed detention sites, and conceptual pond grading and layout there\nwere additional constraints on the detention pond locations.\n\n\n6.3.2 Steep Topography\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe steep slopes on the north end of Steamboat drainage require\nsignificant grading operations to achieve a functional detention volume\neven approaching 0.5 acre feet. This fact alone may still be a viable\nalternative since excavation is generally less expensive than long\nlengths of large storm sewer pipe material, utility crossings, and\ninstallation. However, given the geology of the upper Steamboat drainage\nthe depth to bedrock is known to be very shallow in many locations. Rock\nexcavation for a detention facility is prohibitively expensive.\nExcavation of the rock in a quarry scenario would be one economically\nviable means of providing sufficient detention volume at a reasonable\ncost for Steamboat drainage.\n\n\n6.3.3 Multiple Hillside Ponds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStaged detention facilities staggered in stair-step fashion up the steep\nslopes is another alternative to achieve the benefits of detention\nwithout significant excavation. However, the extensive footprint of\ndisturbance for multiple embankments, overflow spillway design, and\npermanent impact on property makes\n\n\n6.3.4 Property Acquisition\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe natural valleys between 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Streets\nand 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n Streets could provide suitable\ndetention facilities if several existing constraints are mitigated.\nFirst, the private homes in the adjacent parcels would be impacted by\ndetention depths of more than approximately 5 feet. Purchase and\ndemolition of homes affected by a proposed detention facility would be\nrequired to achieve a useful detention volume. Second, the existing\nembankments between 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Street should be\nreconstructed to replace the rock and native soils that were used to\nbuild what is reported to be an old railroad embankment. Until the\ncompaction and stability of that embankment can be verified, it should\nnot be relied upon to safely detain stormwater. It is unclear what the\noverflow path may be should the outlet under the embankment fail,\ncollapse or clog. However it is likely the overflow could lead to\nadditional erosion and scour of the embankment flanks and expedite\ncomplete failure of the embankment. Third, the valleys near the cemetery\nare also candidates for detention, but the steep slopes make each valley\nindividually difficult to achieve a reasonable volume. However, purchase\nof a uniquely shaped parcel of land slicing between the valleys could\nallow an embankment to be constructed that joins the two valleys and\ncreates a reasonable detention volume.\n\n\n6.4 Alternative Categories\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor each outfall system, multiple alternatives were evaluated in the\ninitial screening process including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove storm drain infrastructure to convey minor storm runoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove storm drain infrastructure to the initial storm, and provide\n    detention facilities to reduce infrastructure costs where applicable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove storm drain infrastructure to the major storm runoff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove storm drain infrastructure to the major storm, and provide\n    detention facilities to reduce infrastructure costs where applicable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Alternative Hydraulics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach alternative was modeled using SWMM to determine the pipe sizes\nnecessary to meet the desired alternative criteria. The reduction in\nflooding potential throughout the basin was evaluated for the minor and\nmajor design storm frequencies using FLO-2D.\n\n\n6.6 Alternative Costs\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlternative cost estimates were developed using UDFCD's master planning\ncost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. 2012 unit cost\nvalues were adjusted to present value using the Colorado Construction\nCost Index 2016 Second Quarter Report. A rolling four-quarter inflation\nrate of 1.2673 was used to adjust unit costs.\n\n\nOperation and Maintenance was also included within the UD MP Cost\nworksheet. Manhole and inlet maintenance was assumed to occur once every\nfive years. Maintenance on detention basins and water quality facilities\nwas assumed to occur every other year.\n\n\nInlet quantities were calculated assuming an inlet interception capacity\nof 2 cfs.\n\n\nCosts for Water Quality Basins were estimated using the\nComplete-in-Place detention facility unit costs based on the necessary\nAcre-feet of Water Quality Capture Volume (WQCV) for each outfall.\n\n\nRight of way easement costs were calculated from Boulder County\nAssessor's information. Easement / ROW acquisition amounts were\ncalculated as a percentage of the total actual land value.\n\n\nDewatering, Traffic Control and Utility Coordination / Relocation were\nassigned based on the following percentages of capital costs: Dewatering\n(1%), Traffic Control (5%), Utility Coordination / Relocation (10%).\n\n\nSpecial items that were added to the UD-MP COST spreadsheet include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsphalt Patch: $50 / S.Y. (Pipes with diameter 42 inches and smaller)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsphalt Repaving: $40 / S.Y.

This cost will be refined during conceptual design.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Line Lowering: $5000 / EA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo alterations were made to default values calculated as a percent of\nCapital Improvement Costs, such as Engineering, Legal/Administrative,\nContract Administration/Construction Management, and Contingency.\n\n\n6.7 Alternative Plans\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.1 Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.2 Red Hill Gulch Diversion Channel\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.3 Steamboat Drainage Culvert Replacement\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.4 Steamboat Drainage Interceptors\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.5 Second Avenue Gutter Interceptor\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.6 Second Avenue Inlets and Storm Sewer\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.7 Lyons Valley Inlet Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.8 Lyons Valley South Ditch Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.9 Corona Hill Diversion Ditch\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.7.10 Corona Hill Street Inlets\n\uf0c1",

To improve\nresiliency of the Town to flood disasters, there is an infrastructure\nsolution but that requires a significant capital investment. Grants,\njoint projects, cost shares, and other large scale funding mechanisms\nwill be useful for making those improvements. But a regular funding\nsource for stormwater improvements is equally valuable. A stormwater fee\ncan offset the routine costs of operation and maintenance of stormwater\nfacilities that may otherwise be overlooked in the regular municipal\nbudgeting process. The fee is as much a reminder for proper care of the\nexisting infrastructure as it is a financial support to critical public\nfacilities.\n\n\nStormwater fees can be controversial. A stormwater fee supported by\ndefensible cost projections and allocated on a reasonable and controlled\nmetric can be less controversial than broad based uniform fees. Details\nof a storm water utility implementation are beyond the scope of this\nmaster plan. However, additional information is provided here to start\nthe conversation about implementing a mechanism to fund routine\nstormwater maintenance and projects.\n\n\nStormwater fees exist in many communities along Colorado's front range,\nsome have been around for decades and others are more recently adopted.\n\n\n10.1 What is a Stormwater Utility\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe basic concept of a stormwater utility is to charge property owners\nfor the amount of impervious area on their property in return for\nproviding construction and maintenance of a stormwater system.\nImpervious area consists of manmade surfaces, which prevent the\ninfiltration of rainfall and snowmelt into the ground, and include;\nbuildings, driveways, parking lots, patios, commercial and industrial\nroads, private roads, and other \"hard\" surfaces. It can be estimated\nthat runoff from these impervious surfaces increases 2 to 3 times from\nwhat the runoff was when the parcel was undeveloped. In addition, the\nwater quality of the stormwater is worse than it was when the parcel was\nundeveloped.\n\n\nMost stormwater utilities therefore have a fee based on the amount of\nimpervious area on each parcel. This type of fee, if developed\ncorrectly, has been upheld in the courts of Colorado as a legal fee.\nUnder the Tax Payers Bill of Rights (TABOR), a utility is termed an\nenterprise and is allowed if its meets the TABOR definition of an\nenterprise. Under this definition, an enterprise is a government owned\nbusiness (similar to a water or sewer utility), which derives 90% or\nmore of its revenue from non-governmental sources.\n\n\n10.2 Stormwater Utility Fee Study Outline\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPhase A - Feasibility Study. A data collection and litmus test for\nfeasibility of the stormwater fee. This introduces the concept and\nbuilds the project team of consultants, staff, legal representatives,\nand engineers. This study results in a budget level estimate of fees\nthat could be generated from several alternative mechanisms. (i.e.\nimpervious area, rooftop area, lot size, etc.) The billing options are\nusually a key driving factor in the decision for how the fee is\nimplemented. A town with existing billing systems for water and sewer\nmay be able to easily add on a stormwater fee to the existing invoicing\nand collections systems. However, depending on billing systems or\noperational constraints, a separate invoice may need to be developed\nwith its own schedule. These initial research results will then be\ncompared to adjacent communities and discussed amongst the project team\nto determine a preferred approach. It is at this point the scope of the\nfee will be identified and limitations on how the funds can be spent\nwill be drafted. This work should take between 3 and 4 months and not\nrequire any legislative action.\n\n\nPhase B \u2013 Preliminary Plan. The initial preferences are formalized into\na preliminary plan that can be presented to staff, councils, and the\ngeneral public for review and comment. A municipal and public process\ncan revise and adjust the fees, structure, and invoicing to fit the\nneeds of the administration and general public. This preliminary plan\nwill provide a more accurate estimate of impervious area or other\nmetrics selected to quantify the fee across various properties. A\nselection of a rate structure and any classifications of properties\n(i.e. private, public, non-profit, etc.) can be made at this stage.\nBilling options will be finalized. And inherent to the more defined rate\nstructure will be a discussion on potential credits to the fee (i.e.\ninstallation of rain barrels saves 10% of the fee per year, etc.). An\nimplementation cost for new software, systems, adjustment of existing\nsystems, or migration of existing processes can be estimated. This work\ncould take as long as 6 months and may require public hearings or other\nadministrative processes to document the public process.\n\n\nPhase C \u2013 Implementation. This process finalizes the preliminary plan\nand results in the delivery of the first stormwater fee invoices to the\ncommunity. Consequently, additional public outreach is necessary. Rate\nclasses are finalized for single family, multi family, commercial,\npublic, non-profit and other criteria. A financial outlook projecting\nrevenues and expenditures should be developed to support the final\nadoption of the fee. Public works staff and consultants can be utilized\nto prioritize stormwater utility routine tasks, annual procedures,\nemergency operation allowances, and qualified special projects. A budget\nfor routine tasks may involve a monthly allocation for 12 hours of vac\ntruck time for stormwater inlet cleaning. An annual procedure may be an\ninventory of outfall conditions town-wide. Emergency operation\nallowances can be an agreement that specifies how much of the annual\nstormwater fee budget is reserved for emergency repairs and operations.\nA list of qualifications for special projects that can use the\nstormwater fee can be developed to provide guidance for staff and\nconsultants to use when calls on the stormwater fee are made for repair,\nrehabilitation or improvement of stormwater infrastructure. Before\npresentation of the fee to the legislative process, a trial run of the\nbilling, time keeping, and tracking systems should be run. In some\ncases, this can be a staged implementation where the fee is instituted\nfor public facilities at a trial rate of $1 per parcel. When those\nsystems are functional, the whole project can be presented to council\nfor adoption.\n\n\n10.3 Use of Funds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere can be specific study of how the funds are used. How the funds are\ntransferred within the Town's accounting system is important and\nincludes how the Town staff records their expenses related to\nstormwater. The funds from a stormwater utility should be used primarily\nfor projects benefitting existing development because the existing\nproperty owners pay the fees. New developers are expected to pay their\nshare of major drainage projects serving new development, because they\nare responsible for the excess stormwater their development creates. New\ndevelopments are responsible for the minor drainage infrastructure\nwithin their development such as street drainage systems, and minor\nsystem pipes and channels conveying water to the major drainage\nfacilities.\n\n\n10.4 Range of Nearby Stormwater Utility Fees\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe existing stormwater utilities in nearby communities can provide a\nrough estimate for what a fee may be in Lyons. The range is from less\nthan $1 to more than $11. Berthoud has a fee of approximately $2.50 per\nsingle family residential unit. Greeley, a much larger community, has a\nfee of just over $5 per single family unit. Loveland has a fee over $11\nand has been in existence since the early 1980s. In general, the average\naround the front range of Colorado is about $5 per single family\nresidential unit. However, the average can be misleading as the\nvariables for how the fee is paid, used, and allocated changes for every\ncommunity, land use, and sometimes by year.",
