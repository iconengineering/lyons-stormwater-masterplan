2.0 Study Area Description
==========================

2.1 Project Area
----------------

The project area includes the subbasins tributary to the North Saint
Vrain Creek, South Saint Vrain Creek, Red Hill Gulch, and Stone Canyon
within the Town of Lyons. The total drainage area studied is
approximately 8.6 square miles.

Existing drainage in the Town reflects open channel drainageways in
combination with storm sewer conveyance for more urbanized areas. Most
of the Town's existing drainage infrastructure is undersized due to the
increase in development within the Town during the 1990s. The existing
conveyance system has the capacity to convey nuisance flows, but it does
not have the capacity to convey even the minor (5-year) storm events.

At the time of this report, there are current requests for study and
analysis of potential annexation areas adjacent to the current town
limits. These areas were identified for study after the completion of
the stormwater inventory and hydrologic analysis. However, this study
has provided some limited information relative to adjacent areas.

2.2 Land Use
------------

The study area watershed is comprised of a combination of Hydrologic
Soil Group (HSG) A, B, C, and D soils as classified by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These soil types are very
intermixed with HSG A soils (i.e. soils with increased hydrologic
conductivity) covering areas such as downtown locations, and north-south
along the eastern basin limits. HSG B soils cover the least area in the
watershed, with locations predominately along Saint Vrain Creek, and
north and south branches. HSG C soils are represented along a
north-south plane, along the easternmost portions of the watershed.
Finally, HSG D soils (i.e. soils with the least potential for hydrologic
conductivity) represent the greatest are of the watershed and are
predominately located towards the northern and western watershed limits,
covering rock outcrops and other less permeable sources.

It should be noted that for the study area, the HSG A soils are
colluvial land type soil. According to the colluvial land soil
description, the depth to restrictive feature is 2 to 60 inches to
lithic bedrock. Because of the underlying bedrock, it was assumed that
the HSG A soils would have the drainage characteristics of HSG B soils.

Land use was determined by compiling information from the 2009 Zoning
District Map, 2010 Lyons Planning Area Map, and by ground-truthing the
land cover based on an October 2015 aerial image of the watershed. Each
land use category was assigned a percent imperviousness with guidance
from Chapter 6 â€“ Runoff of the UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage Criteria
Manual. Table 2-1 outlines the land use categories and the corresponding
percent imperviousness. In addition to the land use categories found in
Table 2-1, Boulder County Open Space land use represented a significant
portion of the watershed. Table 2-2 displays the soil types used to
calculate imperviousness for the Boulder County Open Space land use
category.

It should be noted that land use category corresponds to the 2010 Lyons
Planning Area Map. However, in some cases, the planning description and
corresponding lot size were not representative of what is observed
through aerial imagery and field reconnaissance. In these cases, the
imperviousness percentages were revised to be more representative of
what was observed.

Future imperviousness was determined by comparing the land use in the
2010 Lyons Planning Area Map to current aerial imagery, and noting which
areas of the Town could be further developed based on the planning
guidance.

2.3 Outfall Descriptions
-----------------------------

The study area has been divided into eleven separate outfalls based on
their general drainage patterns. A description of each outfall can be
found below with an outfall map found in XXX .

#### 2.3.1 Eagle Canyon

The Eagle Canyon watershed, with a tributary area of 740 acres, is
located west of downtown Lyons. The drainage path for the watershed is a
steep mountain channel with an approximate slope between 5% and 35%. The
channel flows south before turning east near Eagle Canyon Subdivision
before draining into the North St. Vrain Creek. The watershed ranges in
elevation from 6670 feet to 5390 feet. The majority of the watershed is
undeveloped or large lot residential with the exception of the Eagle
Canyon Subdivision. The Eagle Canyon Subdivision drains to the southeast
into an existing detention basin.

#### 2.3.2 Eastern Lyons

The Eastern Lyons Watershed is generally bounded by 2^nd^ Avenue to the
west and Stone Canyon Watershed to the east. The watershed ranges in
elevation from 5850 feet to 5300 feet. The 87 acre watershed conveys
flow southwest to the 2^nd^ Avenue and Main Street intersection. An
existing storm drain intercepts flow from the new development along
1^st^ Avenue discharging onto the street on 2^nd^ Avenue. Flow within
the Eastern Lyons Watershed is conveyed along the east side of 2^nd^
Avenue in a small roadside swale. Any flows exceeding the capacity of
this swale that overtop 2^nd^ Avenue have the possibility of spilling
into the Third Avenue Watershed. A small, 18-inch, storm drain
intercepts minor flows north of Main Street and conveys flow through the
shopping center along Main Street. The storm drain crosses Main Street
discharging into an open channel in the South 2^nd^ Avenue Watershed
before discharging into St. Vrain Creek.

During the course of this study, the Colorado Department of
Transportation initiated a roadway and storm drainage improvements along
Main Street in the vicinity of 2^nd^ Avenue. The as-built documents were
not available at the time of the hydraulic analysis, but an estimated
version of the storm drain system in that area was used in the study.

#### 2.3.3 Ewald Ave

The Ewald Avenue Watershed originates southwest of the North and South
St. Vrain Creek confluence. The 160 acre watershed ranges in elevation
from 5875 feet to 5320 feet. Unlike the other major watersheds, the
Ewald Avenue Watershed does not have a defined channel flow path. The
runoff from this watershed is primarily sheet flow along the steep
hillsides northeast towards the residential developments. The hillside
in the upper reaches of the watershed has an approximately slope of 15
percent. In the developed portion of the watershed the slope is
approximately six percent. The majority of conveyance is through the
residential street with the exception of a 48 inch reinforced concrete
storm drain pipe installed along Park Street from 4^th^ Avenue to North
St. Vrain Creek.

#### 2.3.4 Lyons Valley Park

Located south of St. Vrain Creek, the Lyons Valley Park Watershed is
primarily medium residential lots. The watershed ranges in elevation
from 5860 feet to 5260 feet. The runoff from the 210 acre watershed is
conveyed northeast through the subdivision to St. Vrain Creek. There is
no defined flow path through the watershed as flow is primarily conveyed
down McConnell Drive. There is an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm
drain system on Bohn Court, Noland Court, and Estes Court. Curb side
combination inlets capture stormwater in these areas. The system is
upsized to a 30-inch reinforced concrete pipe at McConnell Drive before
the flow is discharged into the St. Vrain Creek.

#### 2.3.5 North St. Vrain

The North St. Vrain Creek Watershed is a combination of several
subwatersheds that are directly tributary to North St. Vrain Creek.
There are both left and right bank tributaries with subwatersheds
ranging in size from 20 acres to 190 acres. The watersheds vary in land
use including dense residential, commercial, open space, and undeveloped
areas.

#### 2.3.6 Red Hill Gulch

The Red Hill Gulch Watershed is located on the south side of the St.
Vrain Creek ranging in elevation from 6800 feet to 5300 feet. The runoff
from this 1560 acre watershed is conveyed in the upper reaches by an
open channel with an average slope of 5 to 20 percent. The channel
generally follows Red Gulch Road north before flows exit the mountainous
terrain and enters a broad alluvial valley. The runoff continues north
where flows are intercepted by South Ledge Ditch. Any flows exceeding
the capacity of the South Ledge Ditch will overtop the ditch and
continue north. Due to the limited capacity of the irrigation ditch,
major storm events have the possibility of conveying a large volume of
water north into Bohn Park and Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. The
average slope of the overflow path downstream of the South Ledge Ditch
is approximately two percent.

#### 2.3.7 South St. Vrain

The South St. Vrain Creek is a combination of several subwatersheds that
are directly tributary to South St. Vrain Creek. These subwatersheds are
both left and right bank tributaries to the South St. Vrain Creek
ranging in size from 70 acres to 210 acres. The development throughout
the watershed varies from undeveloped to large lot residential.

#### 2.3.8 South 2nd Avenue

The South 2^nd^ Avenue Watershed is bounded by 3^rd^ Avenue to the west,
Main Street to the north and east and the St. Vrain Creek to the south.
The approximately 20 acre watershed drains southeast ranging in
elevation from 5360 feet to 5310 feet. A combination 24-inch storm drain
and open channel system conveys flow along the south side of Main Street
discharging into St. Vrain Creek. An 18-inch storm drain conveys flow
south from the Park Street and 2^nd^ Avenue intersection into St. Vrain
Creek.

#### 2.3.9 Steamboat Valley

The Steamboat Valley watershed is located directly north of downtown,
bounded by the Eagle Canyon Watershed to the west and to the east by the
Third Avenue and Stone Canyon Watersheds. The majority of the 370 acre
watershed converges just upstream of downtown and is conveyed between
4^th^ and 5^th^ Avenue. In the upper reaches, the watershed consists of
large lot residential and undeveloped properties. The lower third of the
watershed is fully developed consisting of residential and commercial
lots. In the lower downtown area the watershed is bounded by 4^th^
Avenue to the east and North St. Vrain Creek to the west. The watershed
ranges in elevation from 6520 feet to 5335 feet.

The flow concentrates in the upper reaches in an open channel with an
approximate slope of 16 percent. The flow continues south into a private
inadvertent storage area on the Russell property upstream of the old
railroad embankment. Downstream of the railroad embankment the
drainageway is confined in a small open channel that conveys flow
through backyards of private property. There are several roadway
crossings within this reach including Vasquez Road, McCall Alley, Reese
Avenue, Steward Avenue, and Stickney Avenue. A reportedly historic stone
box culvert intercepts flow and conveys flow underneath downtown until
the outfall location into North St. Vrain Creek. The slope is
approximately four percent downstream of the railroad embankment.

An 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe collects flow along
5^th^ Street south of Main Street to Park Drive. This pipe increases in
size just downstream of Park Drive to a 28-inch by 16-inch reinforced
concrete elliptical pipe before discharging to North St. Vrain Creek.

Along 4^th^ Avenue an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe
intercepts flow at Stickney Avenue and conveys the flow south to
Railroad Avenue. At Railroad Avenue the storm drain increases in size to
a 24-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe continuing south to the
outfall location into North St. Vrain Creek.

#### 2.3.10 Stone Canyon

The Stone Canyon Watershed is located east of the Third Avenue and
Eastern Lyons Watersheds. In the upper reaches, the 1550 acre watershed
is dominated by large residential and undeveloped properties. The open
channel which conveys the majority of the runoff for the Stone Canyon
watershed has an average slope of approximately four percent. The
watershed ranges in elevation from 6580 feet to 5294 feet.

The open channel drainageway passes through multiple roadway crossings
within Boulder County. Within the Town of Lyons, Stone Canyon is
conveyed underneath Stone Canyon Road through a 13 foot by 8 foot
reinforced concrete box culvert. The drainage path continues south where
flow is conveyed underneath Ute Highway through an 8 foot by 4 foot
reinforced concrete box culvert into St. Vrain Creek.

#### 2.3.11 Third Avenue

The Third Avenue watershed, approximately 170 acres, conveys flow
southwest into the downtown area along Third Avenue. The watershed is
undeveloped upstream of the downtown area bounded by Steamboat Valley to
the west and Eastern Lyons and Stone Canyon. The watershed ranges in
elevation from 6260 feet to 5320 feet. Development within the lower
portions of the watershed is dominated by residential and commercial
development. The watershed discharges flow into North St. Vrain Creek
just upstream of the confluence with South St. Vrain Creek.

An existing 5 foot x 4 foot elliptical pipe conveys flow underneath Main
Street at Third Avenue into the South 2^nd^ Avenue Watershed.
