6.0 Alternative Analysis
========================

6.1 Alternative Development Process
-----------------------------------

An Alternative Analysis was completed to develop flood mitigation
solutions for the problem areas identified in the previous section.
Goals for mitigation focused on solutions to reducing flooding on
insurable structures. Consideration was also given to reducing
infrastructure sizing and costs by incorporating detention.

Alternatives were considered first for open channel and then for piped
systems. Open channels are more cost effective, provide additional
ecological benefits, mimic or sometimes restore the natural environment,
but require additional stabilization and maintenance to provide long
term benefits. Piped systems are far more hydraulically efficient and
allow for more flexible land uses in and around the system, but do not
benefit the natural environment and can be significantly more costly to
install, particularly in underlying rock soils.

For example, the development of downtown Lyons over the historic
drainageway has limited the ability to convey the major storm events
through an open channel system. Since an open channel system is not
feasible, large storm drain infrastructure is needed to reduce the flood
hazards throughout the study area. The storm drain infrastructure must
limit the amount of flow in the street to provide emergency vehicles
access during storm events.

The analysis aimed to develop stormwater solutions first within the Town
of Lyons. When those alternatives were exhausted as cost prohibitive or
unfeasible, then the project team considered alternatives outside of the
Town limits. The cost of land acquisition, land use regulations, and
extra-territorial jurisdiction can add significant costs to stormwater
projects outside of the Town limits. Conversely, knowing about potential
out of town solutions to in-town risks can be prudent to future planning
exercises in annexation, development referrals, and multi-agency
coordination.

6.2 Criteria and Constraints
----------------------------

As noted above, goals for the baseline alternative plan was to provide storm
drainage capacity to meeting currently defined drainage criteria set forth in
the Town of Lyons Storm Drainage System Criteria. The minor storm frequency
for the Town of Lyons is the 2-yr design storm. The major storm frequency for
the Town of Lyons is classified as the 100-yr design storm frequency. The
only inlet type allowed on streets is CDOT Type R inlets.

6.3 Evaluation of Detention
---------------------------

#### 6.3.1 Detention

Detention is a common approach to reduce peak flows, optimize pipe size,
and save on downstream infrastructure costs. Review of the previous
master plan confirmed that previously master planned detention
facilities were drafted to meet this goal. If detention is installed in
the upper watersheds of the Town, there is a significant cost savings to
downstream stormwater infrastructure. However, upon closer examination
of the previous master plan assumptions, field inspection of the
proposed detention sites, and conceptual pond grading and layout there
were additional constraints on the detention pond locations.

#### 6.3.2 Steep Topography

The steep slopes on the north end of Steamboat drainage require
significant grading operations to achieve a functional detention volume
even approaching 0.5 acre feet. This fact alone may still be a viable
alternative since excavation is generally less expensive than long
lengths of large storm sewer pipe material, utility crossings, and
installation. However, given the geology of the upper Steamboat drainage
the depth to bedrock is known to be very shallow in many locations. Rock
excavation for a detention facility is prohibitively expensive.
Excavation of the rock in a quarry scenario would be one economically
viable means of providing sufficient detention volume at a reasonable
cost for Steamboat drainage.

#### 6.3.3 Multiple Hillside Ponds

Staged detention facilities staggered in stair-step fashion up the steep slopes
is another alternative to achieve the benefits of detention without significant
excavation. However, the extensive footprint of disturbance for multiple
embankments, overflow spillway design, and permanent impact on property makes
this a challenging alternative.  If future development, annexation, and
stormwater infrastructure funding allows this alternative can be studied in
greater detail.  For the immediate future, this is a difficult alternative to
consider for near term funding.

#### 6.3.4 Property Acquisition

The natural valleys between 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Streets
and 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Streets could provide suitable
detention facilities if several existing constraints are mitigated.
First, the private homes in the adjacent parcels would be impacted by
detention depths of more than approximately 5 feet. Purchase and
demolition of homes affected by a proposed detention facility would be
required to achieve a useful detention volume. Second, the existing
embankments between 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Street should be
reconstructed to replace the rock and native soils that were used to
build what is reported to be an old railroad embankment. Until the
compaction and stability of that embankment can be verified, it should
not be relied upon to safely detain stormwater. It is unclear what the
overflow path may be should the outlet under the embankment fail,
collapse or clog. However it is likely the overflow could lead to
additional erosion and scour of the embankment flanks and expedite
complete failure of the embankment. Third, the valleys near the cemetery
are also candidates for detention, but the steep slopes make each valley
individually difficult to achieve a reasonable volume. However, purchase
of a uniquely shaped parcel of land slicing between the valleys could
allow an embankment to be constructed that joins the two valleys and
creates a reasonable detention volume.

6.4 Alternative Categories
--------------------------

For the purpose of this study, alternatives were generally developed to
mitigate the flooding hazards identified in Section 5.0. Specific details
related to individual alternatives follow in subsequent report sections.


6.5 Alternative Hydraulics
--------------------------

Alternatives were modeled using EPA SWMM to determine the size of the
structures necessary to convey the design flow. The reduction in flooding
potential throughout the basin was evaluated for the minor and major design
storm frequencies using FLO-2D.

6.6 Alternative Costs
---------------------

Alternative cost estimates were developed using UDFCD's master planning
cost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. 2012 unit cost
values were adjusted to present value using the Colorado Construction
Cost Index 2016 Second Quarter Report. A rolling four-quarter inflation
rate of 1.2673 was used to adjust unit costs.

Operation and Maintenance was also included within the UD MP Cost worksheet.
Maintenance to remove sediment and debris and conduct structural repairs on
storm drain manholes and inlets was assumed to occur one every year.
Maintenance to remove tree and weeds and sediment and debris in open channel
alternatives was also assumed to occur once every year. Costs for maintenance
of the hydraulic drops for the Red Hill Gulch West Channel was assumed to
occur once a year.

Inlet quantities were calculated assuming an inlet interception capacity
of 1 cfs / foot of inlet.

Dewatering, Traffic Control and Utility Coordination / Relocation were
assigned based on the following percentages of capital costs: Dewatering
(1%), Traffic Control (5%), Utility Coordination / Relocation (10%).

Special items that were added to the UD-MP COST spreadsheet include:

-   Asphalt Repaving: $40 / S.Y.

-   Curb and Gutter: $30 / L.F.

No alterations were made to default values calculated as a percent of
Capital Improvement Costs, such as Engineering, Legal / Administrative,
Contract Administration / Construction Management, and Contingency.

6.7 Alternative Plans
---------------------

#### A - Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel East

[![picture](assets/img/6-7a.jpg){: .center-img }](assets/img/6-7a.jpg){: target="_blank" }
*Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel East would intercept flows  
before diverting runoff into Lyons Valley Park Subdivision*
{: .caption }

A diversion channel west of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision is proposed to
intercept overflow from Red Hill Gulch before the discharge damages property.
Any flow exceeding the capacity of the South Ledge Ditch continues north
spilling into Bohn Park and Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. This uncontrolled
spill flow risks the structural integrity of the ditch and poses a hazard to
homes along the west side of Lyons Valley Park. The Red Hill Gulch Overflow
Channel East would intercept flows along the east side of Bohn Park preventing
these flows from diverting into the Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. The grading
associated with the overflow channel would change the surface conditions of
the east side of the park but still allow for parking and multi-purpose uses.
The multiple uses of this eastern side of the park require the channel to be
wider and flatter that typical conveyance channels in order to maintain the
function of the space for parking and exhibitions.

In general, this option intercepts and conveys large storm events from
Red Hill Gulch before those flows encroach on private property. The
alignment utilizes existing town property and requires no additional
easements or property acquisition.

However, this alternative compromises existing functions of the park
land and assumes upstream development will not have an impact on the
drainage conditions. In other words, solving the Red Hill Gulch drainage
this far down in the watershed costs a lot when compared to what
upstream alternatives may do to reduce stormwater impacts.

#### B - Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel West

An alternative to the east channel at the downstream end of the
watershed is a western channel. When the Western Corridor is annexed
into the Town of Lyons the overflow channel alignment should be
evaluated to intercept the flows upstream of Bohn Park eliminating any
disturbance to the park. The flows would be conveyed west of Bohn Park
and discharged into South St. Vrain Creek. This is a smaller channel
used for a singular stormwater purpose – it does not have to share uses
with a park or parking lot. The western alignment also conveys water
around Bohn Park and Lyons Valley subdivision.

However, the channel would require an easement or land acquisition from
the adjoining land owners. And, because of the smaller footprint, the
hydraulics of the channel require drop structures to control erosive
velocities.

#### C - Red Hill Gulch Cut-Off Channel

Outside of the Town, there is another problem area and option for
managing Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff.

A third alternative for Red Hill Gulch drainage intercepts the gulch
flows at the Picture Rock Trailhead and diverts those flows west into
the South St. Vrain. This alternative has the advantage of working a
stormwater solution upstream of existing development and mitigating
flood risk as high up in the watershed as feasible. This is the most
hydraulically efficient alternative in that the diversion distance to
the South St. Vrain is short and the diversion volume is reduced when
compared to downstream alternatives.

However, the constraints on this alternative are compounded by the need
for easement or land acquisition on both public and county open space
property. The details of a diversion in this location will require
careful design and analysis. The surface flows are spread over a large
area, but the right grading could allow just enough water to drain north
through the park area and intercept the remainder to safely divert it
west to the South St. Vrain. Easements and reconstruction of Red Gulch
Road would be required. Existing irrigation ditches in the area compound
problems rerouting surface flows. Any diversion would still have to
cross Ledge Ditch and Meadow Ditch.

There are several roadside ditches and ditch crossings that should be
investigated further. The stormwater flows into Ledge and Meadow ditches
complicate the flow paths for this drainage. Upstream and downstream of
the irrigation ditches, the roadside swales are an important part of
conveying stormwater but need to be maintained to ensure positive
drainage away from the roadway.

#### D - Steamboat Drainage Culvert Replacement

The historic flowpath of Steamboat Valley Watershed conveys flow south
between Fourth and Fifth Avenue through private property. The existing
confined channel and culvert roadway crossings could be replaced with a
reinforced concrete box culvert conveying the entire 100-year design flow.
The proposed culvert replacement along the existing alignment uses the natural
topography to convey the runoff to the new culvert. However, implementing
this alternative would require extensive easements as the historic culvert
runs through the downtown area underneath development on private properties.

#### E - Steamboat Drainage Interceptors

The Steamboat Drainage Interceptor Alternative proposes to intercept flow just
downstream of the private railroad embankment at McCalley Alley. Flows in
excess of the existing channel and roadway crossing capacity would be
intercepted and conveyed west to Fifth Avenue. The storm drain system would
continue south where the system would outfall into North St. Vrain Creek.
This alternative proposes a lateral in Fourth Avenue from Stickney Avenue to
North St. Vrain Creek to intercept local runoff in the lower portions of the
Steamboat Valley Watershed.

#### F - Third Avenue Inlets and Storm Drain

To mitigate flood hazards associated with the Third Avenue Watershed, a storm
drain is proposed along Third Avenue from Cemetry Circle to North St. Vrain
Creek. A lateral along Stickney Avenue is proposed to intercept flow from the
east as it enters the residential area. Continuing the storm drain system
south of Main Street would mitigate some of the flooding hazards within the
South Second Avenue Watershed. Any flows in excess of the existing storm
drain in the Third Avenue Watershed currently spill in the South 2nd Avenue
Watershed impacting properties.

However, it is important to note that excavation in the northern end of
the Third Avenue basin is likely to encounter rock and other earthwork
complications. Depth of inlets and storm sewers will be limited by
excavation cost, which limits the hydraulic head and increases pipe
size. As pipe size increases, depth to cover the pipe must increase and
become a costly design loop to determine a feasible storm sewer
alignment.

#### G - Lower 3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue Inlet

Excess surface flows on 3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue could be conveyed to a
large storm sewer inlet at the existing storm sewers on the southeast
corner of 3<sup>rd</sup> and Broadway. The existing grated inlets on the
west flowline of 3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue at Main Street could be improved,
but flows exceeding the capacity of those inlets will continue south on
3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue. The proposed lower 3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue inlets
would capture flows from both gutter flowlines to maintain safe street
capacity on the south end of 3<sup>rd</sup> Avenue during storm events.

The west flowline is also one of the locations where surface flows could
be routed through a minor storm weir into a small volume water quality
pond in the east end of Sandstone Park. The pond would treat ‘first
flush' or the initial runoff volume with larger flows continuing south.

#### H - Third Avenue Drainage Interceptors

Similar to the Steamboat drainage alternative, the surface conveyance on
Third Avenue could be improved instead of excavation and installation of
inlets and pipes. The surface conveyance improvement contains flows
within the Town ROW, gutters, and directs flow south to the river. This
reduces many of the overflows into private property that exceed the
existing roadway swales or smaller curbs. This alternative also reduces
surface flows intercepted at cross street intersections that drain water
into private property and complicate street flows entering Steamboat
drainage.

This alternative does not resolve major storm overflows. The minor
storms are handled with the interceptor gutters and cross pans. However,
when those conveyance paths are at capacity, the overflow will continue
down the natural topography. An inlet and pipe system could be sized to
convey a much larger portion of the major storm event. But, as a
relatively low cost alternative, the benefits are tangible.

#### I - Eastern Lyons - Second Avenue Gutter Interceptor

Recent development within the Eastern Lyons watershed has increased the
runoff from the hillside causing local flooding problems. For larger
events the existing roadway conveyance and roadside swale along 2nd
Avenue does not adequately convey the runoff south along 2nd Avenue
instead diverting flow to the west into the Third Avenue Watershed.
Formalizing the street conveyance by installing curb and gutters and
cross pans in 2nd Avenue would encourage runoff from this watershed to
continue south along 2nd Avenue and not impact properties the Third
Avenue Watershed.

#### J - Eastern Lyons - Second Avenue Inlets and Storm Sewer

To ensure no runoff diverts from the Eastern Lyons Watershed, inlets and a
storm drain pipe can be installed along 2nd Avenue. The storm drain inlets and
pipe in combination with curb and gutter would intercept the flow and convey
the flow south to Main Street. South of Main Street the storm drain would
convey runoff to the Second Avenue and Park Street intersection before turning
east to the outfall location into the St. Vrain Creek.

#### K - Lyons Valley Inlet Improvements

Runoff from the upper portions of the subwatershed sheet flows in a general
northeast direction through the subdivision to St. Vrain Creek. The storm
drain infrastructure installed with the development of Lyons Valley Park
Subdivision is a minor drainage system and lacks capacity to convey major
storm events. This alternative proposes to increases the storm drain along the
existing alignment to convey the design flow for the 100-year storm.

#### L - Lyons Valley South Ditch Improvements

The South Ledge Ditch located south of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision
intercepts runoff from the subwatershed. Formalizing the ditch to convey
stormwater east towards St. Vrain Creek would reduce the tributary area
contributing to the flooding hazards of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision.

This alternative should be developed in coordination with the future
development of Lyons Valley. A drainage feature around the south end of
the currently platted lots would benefit the new construction as well as
the existing homes in the neighborhood.

The greatest limitation of this alternative is the operation and
maintenance of the irrigation ditch and the coordination with any future
development. Breaches and overtopping of the existing ditch are likely
to continue to occur given the earthern embankment construction of the
ditch. As the platted future development moves into the final plan
approval process, careful coordination should identify the benefits to
both existing and future homes in the area. And, when the cost of
perimeter surface water conveyance (i.e. swale) is compared to sizing
interior storm inlets and pipes sized to safely capture and convey the
offsite flows, the cost-benefit should resolve any further limitations
of the concept.

#### M - Lyons Valley McConnel Drive Culvert

The impervious area of the school campus leads to nuisance drainage
issues along McConnel Drive. It is unclear how the stormwater runoff is
treated within the school campus, but the roof drains and parking along
the east side of the campus are direct discharge to the west gutter of
McConnel Drive. On-site water quality and detention facilities, perhaps
conversion of part of the irrigated turf areas, would collect, treat,
and attenuate on-site discharges. A pond near the northeast corner of
the site could connect to a new underground storm sewer tied into the
Type R inlets at 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue. This would move surface flow,
particularly nuisance flows dribbling winter melt water that freezes
overnight, into the on-site pond and underground, safely conveyed in a
pipe system.

#### N - Ewald Ave - Corona Hill Diversion Ditch

As witnessed in the 1994 event, the Ewald Avenue Watershed poses a
significant flooding hazard to downstream properties within the
watershed. High velocity runoff flow off Corona Hill can carry debris
into the residential neighborhood. Intercepting the flow upstream of the
development and conveying the flow to the south would prevent debris
flow from impacting private properties. The diversion channel south of
the development would require significant energy dissipation to prevent
the discharge from reaching high velocities and eroding the hillside
south of the development. The steep slopes along the hillside would make
construction of any diversion channel difficult.

#### O - Ewald Ave - Corona Hill Street Inlets

An alternative to intercepting flows upstream of the residential development
is formalizing street conveyance and installing storm drain infrastructure
along Prospect Road. The storm drain infrastructure in combination with curb
and gutter improvements would confine the runoff from Corona Hill to the
street limiting the impact to private properties. The storm drain system would
continue east along Prospect Road to the confluence area between North and
South St. Vrain Creek

#### P - 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue – Kelling Drive Private Improvements

There are past stormwater runoff events that have led to private
property damages (fencing, landscaping, and structural flooding).
Magnitude of the damages has not be investigated as part of this study.
The subject properties, residential structures on the north side of
Kelling Drive and commercial structures on the south side of Kelling
Drive, are near the bottom of a steep southwestern facing slope. Runoff
from the upstream property impervious area is controlled through
downspouts, gutters, landscape swales, street gutters, and storm sewer
systems.

The northern properties appear to have all or most of their foundations
above adjacent grade, positive drainage away from the structure.
However, additional property line swales could convey surface flows
around the structures. The southern properties appear to have adverse
drainage slopes near the building and could benefit from more formalized
drain pans along top or toe of the retaining walls on the north side of
the property. An existing grated inlet in the north flowline of Kelling
Drive could be improved to increase surface water capture, but only
reduces surface flows already in the street.

Support from the Town in terms of permitting, review, and easement
terminology could resolve drainage issues in the vicinity of Kelling
Drive. The installation of swales, inlets, pipes, moving existing
outbuildings, and re-landscaping perimeter swales on each of the
affected lots can be highly effective private improvements that mitigate
the flood risks in this area. However, the work would be on private
property and therefore require special agreements (easements,
cost-sharing, access requirements, or code updates, etc.) for the Town
to participate in design, construction, operation, maintenance, or
financing. Therefore, the town's assistance could come in the form of
coordinating the private efforts to ensure a comprehensive solution is
achieved.

#### Q - Stone Canyon Outfall Improvements

Downstream of Stone Canyon Road, private development has infringed on Stone
Canyon Drainageway. The existing roadway crossing at Ute Highway lacks the
capacity to convey the 100-year discharge without overtopping the roadway. A
significant box culvert roadway crossing structure would be required to convey
the 100-year discharge without overtopping. The conveyance of Stone Canyon
Drainageway downstream of Stone Canyon Road to the St. Vrain Creek should be
analyzed in further detail when the Eastern Corridor expansion is finalized.
