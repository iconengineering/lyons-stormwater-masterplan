7.0 Water Quality Improvements
==============================

Comprehensive stormwater management includes a wide variety of rainfall
scenarios from exceedingly rare peak flow events to statistically
average events to brief afternoon rain showers. The best plans
acknowledge all phases of stormwater management and provide benefits
throughout the watershed and throughout the range of recurrence
intervals.

Constraints to this approach are clearly financial, the major capital
improvement projects are expensive and the minor water quality BMPs can
become costly pieces of infrastructure to maintain in working order.
However, there are localized water quality improvements that can be
implemented in certain watersheds in specific communities. These smaller
scale projects fit within smaller towns well because a reasonable
implementation density (i.e. participation percentage) is within reach
of public-private partnerships.

Other larger scale water quality projects are just as important to the
overall stream health. Larger ponds integrated into public spaces are a
typical method of capturing a large water quality volume. Ordinances
that require water quality implementation for new and redevelopment can
be equally important. (See Appendix X for examples.)

7.1 Small Scale Water Quality Improvements
------------------------------------------

#### 7.1.1 Tree Wells

The downtown area could benefit from design of landscape and streetscape
improvements that incorporate water quality treatment. One example of
this multi-purpose streetscape is a tree-well water quality
installation. Additional information is provided by the EPA’s
[“Stormwater to Street Trees” informational
guide.](http://www.davey.com/media/183712/stormwater_to_street_trees.pdf){: target="_blank" } 

The tree wells have an advantage of water quality treatment in the
highly impervious main street area, but also have application in side
street and park areas. In any case, the tree wells treat for water
quality, but from a volumetric standpoint are a small scale solution.

#### 7.1.2 Rain Gardens

Another small scale option for targeted water quality is installation of
rain gardens. Generally accepted as a means of treating roof top runoff
from private property downspouts, there are applications for rain
gardens in commercial and municipal applications. A commercial property
or municipal building could route downspouts to a street side rain
garden, with proper consideration for saturation of soils resulting
impact on roadways, sidewalks, icing, and maintenance. A cul-de-sac or
small parking area could be routed to an infiltration basin or rain
garden for additional water quality treatment. [Additional design and
maintenance information is provided by
UDFCD.](http://udfcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/T-03-Bioretention.pdf){: target="_blank" } 

#### 7.1.3 Rainwater Harvesting

Recent changes in state law (HB 1005) allow for private properties to
harvest a small amount of rainwater from their rooftop for allowable
uses (irrigation) on their property. Typically, a 55 gallon barrel or
cistern is connected to roof downspouts to collect rainfall and
snowmelt. Although rooftop runoff is not the largest source of
stormwater pollution, it can still have a beneficial impact on urban
water quality. The dust and wind blown litter that reaches rooftops can
be captured in rain water harvesting systems. More importantly, the peak
runoff events from the impervious surfaces are attenuated, or delayed,
from entering the municipal stormwater system. [This reduces the volume
of stormwater treated by downstream
systems.](http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/natural-resources/rainwater-collection-colorado-6-707/){: target="_blank" } 

7.2 Large Scale Water Quality Improvements
------------------------------------------

#### 7.2.1 Confluence Area Water Quality Pond

At the time of this report, the ongoing confluence area and St. Vrain
restoration projects are making improvements in and around the rivers.
One area that could have an advantageous siting for a water quality pond
is the east end of Prospect in the confluence area. If other project
designs allow for a pond to be constructed in this area, the outlet
could be configured to treat a water quality capture volume for the
confluence area basin.

There are other water quality pond locations, but the confluence area
was identified as the largest potential pond with urbanized runoff. The
existing pond at Eagle Canyon could be studied for reconfiguration, but
the impervious area is relatively low in that overall basin. Large water
quality ponds along the northern side of Town near the river would treat
the most urbanized stormwater runoff. However, a property and
topographic review of the area could not identify areas large enough to
capture a full water quality capture volume. Sandstone Park was the
largest open space parcel, but would require significant grading and
storm sewer installation that would significantly limit the park uses.
Other upstream areas are available, but generally treat only the
undeveloped portions of town.

#### 7.2.2 Streambank Wetlands

There are several good locations for water quality treatment along the
St. Vrain, particularly downstream of Lyons Valley stormwater outlet
structures. The side channels north and south of McConnell Drive as well
as the Bohn Park outfall east of 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue can treat
stormwater runoff upstream of the St. Vrain main channel. Wetland
plantings in a specifically designed low velocity channel can absorb
pollutants conveyed through nuisance and first flush stormwater events,
while allowing larger runoff events to pass through the channel. The
streambank wetlands are similar to the St. Vrain restoration work
upstream, but designed and managed on a smaller scale to adapt to the
side tributary flows.

#### 7.2.3 Pervious Pavers

The reduction of impervious area is a direct means of increasing
infiltration and interrupting the transmission of water borne pollutants
in the urbanized watershed. For the Main Street and downtown areas, the
addition of pervious pavers can be a good way to reduce impervious area.
There are several candidate locations in parking areas, sidewalks, plaza
areas that could infiltrate runoff before it reaches the curb and gutter
system. However, there are also many lessons learned on maintenance of
pervious pavement surfaces, specifically related to the winter
environment and non-infiltrating soils of Colorado. The impact of a snow
plow on pavers, expansion of clay soils creating ponding in pervious
asphalt, or the freeze thaw action on pervious concrete surfaces are all
documented issues. Ultimately, pervious pavement surfaces work well when
combined with traditional pavement surfaces for high traffic, heavy
load, and high maintenance pathways. The UDFCD has a [good
worksheet](http://udfcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/T-10-Permeable-Pavements.pdf){: target="_blank" } 
describing the opportunities and limitations of pervious surfaces.

7.3 Outfall Water Quality
-------------------------

There is a separate category of water quality treatment that is
particularly suited to the Town of Lyons – outfall water quality. Given
the limitations on property, soils, and age of the infrastructure in
Lyons the outfall pipes discharge directly into the rivers. In many
ways, the outfall is the last option for water quality treatment in a
particular watershed. Other communities along Front Range have
investigated these same challenges and found a few specific treatment
options that have unique water quality advantages. It takes a very
unique topographic condition with a small tributary basin for these
elements to meet a full water quality capture volume. But, in all cases,
the advantage of intercepting even the ‘urban drool’ nuisance flows in a
small, maintainable, vegetated basin improves even the perception of a
standard metal culvert dribbling directly into the river.

A list of outfall water quality options are detailed in the appendix.
Each option is suited for different outfall locations and uses. The
infiltration basin concepts are essentially miniaturized infiltration
basins with a design suitable for curbside maintenance. Whereas the
level spreaders are more complicated structures diverting low flows into
hillside infiltration laterals that can irrigate and help sustain native
vegetation on the stream banks. These concepts require additional design
based on site specific conditions, but can be a starting point for high
visual impact outfall improvement projects.
