1.0 Introduction
================

1.1 Authorization
-----------------

This study was authorized by the Town of Lyons, under contract with ICON
dated xxxx.

1.2 Purpose and Scope
---------------------

The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive stormwater
master plan for the Town of Lyons. The focus of the study is to:

-   Quantify stormwater runoff and quantity

-   Identify potential flood hazards and problem areas for subbasins
    tributary to North St. Vrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, and St.
    Vrain Creek, as they flow through the Town

-   Identify and prioritize capital improvement projects to reduce flood
    frequency and flood risk

-   Recommended improvement to enhance water quality and meet other
    sustainable objectives

-   Provide a guide for redevelopment within the Town of Lyons.

The original drainage master plan for the Town of Lyons was completed by
BRW, Inc. in 1998. This study will provide and update to the 1998 plan.

The following is a summary of the scope of work completed for the Town
of Lyons Storm Drainage Master Planning study:

-   Data Collection and Review

-   Field inventory of existing stormwater features

-   Baseline Hydrology and Hydraulics

    -   Document rainfall using NOAA Atlas 14

    -   Develop a basin-wide two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to
        estimate general flow paths within the watershed.

    -   Define individual subwatershed boundaries

    -   Develop hydrologic models for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year
        return period storms subject to the following guidelines:

        -   Use the Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) to
            generate basin runoff hydrographs

        -   Use the Environment Protection Agency Storm Water Management
            Model (EPA SWMM) to route the individual hydrographs

        -   Evaluate the performance of existing storm drain
            infrastructure 24 inches or greater in size

    -   Identify residual flood potential within the basin using a
        two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, such as FLO-2D

-   Alternatives Analysis

    -   Identify existing and future potential drainage and water
        quality problems along tributary paths to North St. Vrain Creek,
        South St. Vrain Creek, and St. Vrain Creek, as they flow through
        the Town

    -   Document existing wetland and riparian zones along the outfall
        paths

    -   Develop and evaluate alternative plans on an outfall-by-outfall
        basis to reduce flooding potential on insurable structures and
        to provide water quality treatment

    -   Estimate benefits of flood reduction

-   Conceptual Design

    -   Development of a selected plan, refined to an approximate 20%
        design level

    -   Identify a Phasing and Prioritization Plan for improvements

1.3 Mapping and Survey
----------------------

One foot interval contours were generated from LiDAR project mapping.
Project mapping was based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
2013 Post-flood LiDAR mapping with the following attributes and is
equivalent to 1-foot contour interval topographic mapping:

*Name: 2013 South Platte River Flood Area 1*

*Collection Date: Fall 2013 - Spring 2014*

*Vertical Accuracy: 9.25 cm RMSE*

*Point Spacing: 0.7 m*

*Vertical Datum: NAVD88*

*Horizontal Datum: NAD83*

Survey data at existing storm drains and sewers were collected by ICON
Engineering and associated sub-consultants as part of this contract. All
survey was also gathered on NAD83 horizontal datum and the NAVD88
vertical datum.
