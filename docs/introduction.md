1.0 Introduction
================

1.1 Authorization
-----------------

This report was authorized by the Town of Lyons in the Disaster Recovery
Services Agreement of February 16, 2016. A fully executed agreement was
received by ICON Engineering Inc. on March 28, 2016. This study was
supported by the grant funding from the Community Development Block
Grant Disaster Recovery program.

1.2 Purpose and Scope
---------------------

Stormwater Master Plans are commonly used by local and regional
governments in a manner similar to land use, parks, or other master
plans. These plans become part of the local community's comprehensive
and capital improvement plans. Stormwater master plans help community
leaders, planners, and engineers work with developers and private land
owners. Stormwater drainage is unaffected by administrative or paper
boundaries and a stormwater master plan helps all parties understand the
natural conditions, constraints, and opportunities to manage stormwater
in a safe, compliant, and sustainable manner. Like most master plans,
this report provides the Town a starting point for ensuring the public
safety and welfare of its citizens, businesses, and visitors.

The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive stormwater
master plan for the Town of Lyons. The focus of the study is to:

-   Quantify stormwater runoff and quantity

-   Identify potential flood hazards and problem areas for subbasins
    tributary to North St. Vrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, and St.
    Vrain Creek, as they flow through the Town

-   Identify and prioritize capital improvement projects to reduce flood
    frequency and flood risk

-   Recommended improvement to enhance water quality and meet other
    sustainable objectives

-   Provide a guide for increasing stormwater resilience within the Town
    of Lyons.

The original drainage master plan for the Town of Lyons was completed by
BRW, Inc. in 1998. This study will provide and update to the 1998 plan.
Today, the Town has grown beyond the limits of the 1998 study.
Furthermore, updates to the means and methods of engineering analysis
provide additional information to determine risk and benefits. This
Stormwater Master Plan utilizes current topographic, property, and
engineering data collected between 2013 and 2016. Like its predecessor,
this report is likely to serve the community for many years to come.

This study initially identified and inventoried stormwater
infrastructure throughout town. A geospatial database of over 250
features was collected and is being incorporated into the Town's larger
GIS inventory. From that point, hydrologic analysis was completed to
determine the range of stormwater runoff from each of the Town's
drainage basins. A hydraulic analysis used the stormwater runoff values
to model how the surface waters drained through town. The existing storm
sewer system was evaluated to determine how capture and conveyance
systems operated during the various design storms. The resulting flood
depth maps were used to identify or confirm problem areas and structures
at risk of flood damages. Alternative solutions to mitigate the
potential damages were developed. Each alternative was considered for
resulting benefits (i.e. averted damages) and costs. A recommended plan
was developed to guide the town through future infrastructure, land use,
and stormwater management decisions. Additional information was
developed for System Maintenance, Storm Water Utility, Adjacent
Watersheds, and Water Quality.

The following is a summary of the scope of work completed for the Town
of Lyons Storm Drainage Master Planning study:

-   Data Collection and Review

-   Field inventory of existing stormwater features

-   Baseline Hydrology and Hydraulics

    -   Document rainfall using NOAA Atlas 14

    -   Develop a basin-wide two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to
        estimate general flow paths within the watershed.

    -   Define individual subwatershed boundaries

    -   Develop hydrologic models for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year
        return period storms subject to the following guidelines:

        -   Use the Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) to
            generate basin runoff hydrographs

        -   Use the Environment Protection Agency Storm Water Management
            Model (EPA SWMM) to route the individual hydrographs

        -   Evaluate the performance of existing storm drain
            infrastructure 24 inches or greater in size

    -   Evaluate hydrologic condition for 120% of the 100-year return
        period

    -   Identify residual flood potential within the basin using a
        two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, such as FLO-2D

-   Alternatives Analysis

    -   Identify existing and future potential drainage and water
        quality problems along tributary paths to North St. Vrain Creek,
        South St. Vrain Creek, and St. Vrain Creek, as they flow through
        the Town

    -   Develop and evaluate alternative plans on an outfall-by-outfall
        basis to reduce flooding potential on insurable structures and
        to provide water quality treatment

    -   Estimate benefits of flood reduction

-   Capital Improvements Plan

    -   Development of a recommended approach to stormwater management
        within the Town Limits

    -   Identify a Phasing and Prioritization Plan for improvements

1.3 Mapping and Survey
----------------------

One foot interval contours were generated from LiDAR project mapping.
Project mapping was based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
2013 Post-flood LiDAR mapping with the following attributes and is
equivalent to 1-foot contour interval topographic mapping:

*Name: 2013 South Platte River Flood Area 1*

*Collection Date: Fall 2013 â€“ Spring 2014*

*Vertical Accuracy: 9.25 cm RMSE*

*Point Spacing: 0.7 m*

*Vertical Datum: NAVD88*

*Horizontal Datum: NAD83*

Survey data at existing storm drains and sewers were collected by ICON
Engineering and associated sub-consultants as part of this contract. All
survey was also gathered on NAD83 horizontal datum and the NAVD88
vertical datum.

An inventory of existing storm sewer infrastructure was completed
between May and July 2016. A photo, description, condition, and location
of each structure was recorded in the field and stored in a geospatial
database. The geospatial data has been utilized within the Town's larger
GIS database. A link to the online repository for the data is available
for review [here](https://iconengineering.github.io/lyons/collection){: target="_blank" }.
This online repository link will expire in
the near future, but the data is preserved in perpetuity through the
Town's GIS database.
