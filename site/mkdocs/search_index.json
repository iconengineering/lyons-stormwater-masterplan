A fully executed agreement was\nreceived by ICON Engineering Inc. on March 28, 2016. This study was\nsupported by the grant funding from the Community Development Block\nGrant Disaster Recovery program.\n\n\n1.2 Purpose and Scope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStormwater Master Plans are commonly used by local and regional\ngovernments in a manner similar to land use, parks, or other master\nplans. These plans become part of the local community's comprehensive\nand capital improvement plans. Stormwater master plans help community\nleaders, planners, and engineers work with developers and private land\nowners. Stormwater drainage is unaffected by administrative or paper\nboundaries and a stormwater master plan helps all parties understand the\nnatural conditions, constraints, and opportunities to manage stormwater\nin a safe, compliant, and sustainable manner. Like most master plans,\nthis report provides the Town a starting point for ensuring the public\nsafety and welfare of its citizens, businesses, and visitors.\n\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive stormwater\nmaster plan for the Town of Lyons. The focus of the study is to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantify stormwater runoff and quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify potential flood hazards and problem areas for subbasins\n    tributary to North St. Vrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, and St.\n    Vrain Creek, as they flow through the Town\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and prioritize capital improvement projects to reduce flood\n    frequency and flood risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended improvement to enhance water quality and meet other\n    sustainable objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a guide for increasing stormwater resilience within the Town\n    of Lyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original drainage master plan for the Town of Lyons was completed by\nBRW, Inc. in 1998. This study will provide and update to the 1998 plan.\nToday, the Town has grown beyond the limits of the 1998 study.\nFurthermore, updates to the means and methods of engineering analysis\nprovide additional information to determine risk and benefits. This\nStormwater Master Plan utilizes current topographic, property, and\nengineering data collected between 2013 and 2016. Like its predecessor,\nthis report is likely to serve the community for many years to come.\n\n\nThis study initially identified and inventoried stormwater\ninfrastructure throughout town. A geospatial database of over 250\nfeatures was collected and is being incorporated into the Town's larger\nGIS inventory. From that point, hydrologic analysis was completed to\ndetermine the range of stormwater runoff from each of the Town's\ndrainage basins. A hydraulic analysis used the stormwater runoff values\nto model how the surface waters drained through town. The existing storm\nsewer system was evaluated to determine how capture and conveyance\nsystems operated during the various design storms. The resulting flood\ndepth maps were used to identify or confirm problem areas and structures\nat risk of flood damages. Alternative solutions to mitigate the\npotential damages were developed. Each alternative was considered for\nresulting benefits (i.e. averted damages) and costs. A recommended plan\nwas developed to guide the town through future infrastructure, land use,\nand stormwater management decisions.

The total drainage area studied is\napproximately 8.6 square miles.\n\n\nExisting drainage in the Town reflects open channel drainageways in\ncombination with storm sewer conveyance for more urbanized areas. Most\nof the Town's existing drainage infrastructure is undersized due to the\nincrease in development within the Town during the 1990s. The existing\nconveyance system has the capacity to convey nuisance flows, but it does\nnot have the capacity to convey even the minor (5-year) storm events.\n\n\nAt the time of this report, there are current requests for study and\nanalysis of potential annexation areas adjacent to the current town\nlimits. These areas were identified for study after the completion of\nthe stormwater inventory and hydrologic analysis. However, this study\nhas provided some limited information relative to adjacent areas.\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2-1: Watersheds Map\n\n\n2.2 Land Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe study area watershed is comprised of a combination of Hydrologic\nSoil Group (HSG) A, B, C, and D soils as classified by the Natural\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS). These soil types are very\nintermixed with HSG A soils (i.e. soils with increased hydrologic\nconductivity) covering areas such as downtown locations, and north-south\nalong the eastern basin limits. HSG B soils cover the least area in the\nwatershed, with locations predominately along Saint Vrain Creek, and\nnorth and south branches. HSG C soils are represented along a\nnorth-south plane, along the easternmost portions of the watershed.\nFinally, HSG D soils (i.e. soils with the least potential for hydrologic\nconductivity) represent the greatest are of the watershed and are\npredominately located towards the northern and western watershed limits,\ncovering rock outcrops and other less permeable sources.\n\n\nIt should be noted that for the study area, the HSG A soils are\ncolluvial land type soil.

A description of each outfall can be\nfound below with an outfall map found in XXX .\n\n\n2.3.1 Eagle Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Eagle Canyon watershed, with a tributary area of 740 acres, is\nlocated west of downtown Lyons. The drainage path for the watershed is a\nsteep mountain channel with an approximate slope between 5% and 35%. The\nchannel flows south turning east near Eagle Canyon Subdivision before\ndraining along the left bank of North St. Vrain Creek. The watershed\nranges in elevation from 6670 feet to 5390 feet. The majority of the\nwatershed is undeveloped or large lot residential with the exception of\nthe Eagle Canyon Subdivision. The Eagle Canyon Subdivision drains to the\nsoutheast into an existing detention basin before discharging into Eagle\nCanyon drainage.\n\n\n2.3.2 Eastern Lyons\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nEastern Lyons Watershed on First Avenue looking towards downtown\n\n\nThe Eastern Lyons Watershed is generally bounded by 2\nnd\n\nAvenue to the west and Stone Canyon Watershed to the east. The watershed\nranges in elevation from 5850 feet to 5300 feet. The 87 acre watershed\nconveys flow southwest to the 2\nnd\n Avenue and Main Street\nintersection. An existing storm drain intercepts flow from the new\ndevelopment along 1\nst\n Avenue discharging onto the street on\n2\nnd\n Avenue. Flow within the Eastern Lyons Watershed is\nconveyed along the east side of 2\nnd\n Avenue in a small\nroadside swale. Any flows exceeding the capacity of this swale that\novertop 2\nnd\n Avenue have the possibility of spilling into the\nThird Avenue Watershed. A small, 18-inch, storm drain intercepts minor\nflows north of Main Street and conveys flow through the shopping center.\nThe storm drain crosses Main Street discharging into an open channel in\nthe South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed before discharging into St.\nVrain Creek.\n\n\nDuring the course of this study, the Colorado Department of\nTransportation initiated a roadway and storm drainage improvements along\nMain Street in the vicinity of 2\nnd\n Avenue. The as-built\ndocuments were not available at the time of the hydraulic analysis, but\nan estimated version of the storm drain system in that area was used in\nthe study.\n\n\n2.3.3 Ewald Ave\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nEwald Watershed looking east down Prospect Street\n\n\nThe Ewald Avenue Watershed originates southwest of the North and South\nSt. Vrain Creek confluence. The 160 acre watershed ranges in elevation\nfrom 5875 feet to 5320 feet. Unlike the other major watersheds, the\nEwald Avenue Watershed does not have a defined channel flow path. The\nrunoff from this watershed is primarily sheet flow along the steep\nhillsides northeast towards the residential developments. The hillside\nin the upper reaches of the watershed has an approximately slope of 15\npercent. In the developed portion of the watershed the slope is\napproximately six percent. The majority of conveyance is through the\nresidential street with the exception of a 48 inch reinforced concrete\nstorm drain pipe installed along Park Street from 4\nth\n Avenue\nto North St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.4 Lyons Valley Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nLyons Valley Park looking south towards hogback\n\n\nLocated south of St. Vrain Creek, the Lyons Valley Park Watershed is\nprimarily medium residential lots. The watershed ranges in elevation\nfrom 5860 feet to 5260 feet. The runoff from the 210 acre watershed is\nconveyed northeast through the subdivision to St. Vrain Creek. There is\nno defined flow path through the watershed as flow is primarily conveyed\ndown McConnell Drive. There is an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm\ndrain system on Bohn Court, Noland Court, and Estes Court. Curb side\ncombination inlets capture stormwater in these areas. The system is\nupsized to a 30-inch reinforced concrete pipe at McConnell Drive before\nthe flow is discharged into the St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.5 North St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe North St. Vrain Creek Watershed is a combination of several\nsubwatersheds that are directly tributary to North St. Vrain Creek.\nThere are both left and right bank tributaries with subwatersheds\nranging in size from 20 acres to 190 acres. The watersheds vary in land\nuse including dense residential, commercial, open space, and undeveloped\nareas.\n\n\n2.3.6 Red Hill Gulch\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nHeadwaters of the Red Hill Gulch Watershed\n\n\n \n\nRed Hill Gulch Watershed exiting the canyons\n\n\nThe Red Hill Gulch Watershed is located on the south side of the St.\nVrain Creek ranging in elevation from 6800 feet to 5300 feet. The runoff\nfrom this 1560 acre watershed is conveyed in the upper reaches by an\nopen channel with an average slope of 5 to 20 percent. The channel\ngenerally follows Red Gulch Road north before flows exit the mountainous\nterrain and enters a broad alluvial valley. The runoff continues north\nwhere flows are intercepted by South Ledge Ditch. Any flows exceeding\nthe capacity of the South Ledge Ditch will overtop the ditch and\ncontinue north. Due to the limited capacity of the irrigation ditch,\nmajor storm events have the possibility of conveying a large volume of\nwater north into Bohn Park and Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. The\naverage slope of the overflow path downstream of the South Ledge Ditch\nis approximately two percent.\n\n\n2.3.7 South St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe South St. Vrain Creek is a combination of several subwatersheds that\nare directly tributary to South St. Vrain Creek. These subwatersheds are\nboth left and right bank tributaries to the South St. Vrain Creek\nranging in size from 70 acres to 210 acres. The development throughout\nthe watershed varies from undeveloped to large lot residential.\n\n\n2.3.8 South 2nd Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed is bounded by 3\nrd\n\nAvenue to the west, Main Street to the north and east and the St. Vrain\nCreek to the south. The approximately 20 acre watershed drains southeast\nranging in elevation from 5360 feet to 5310 feet. A combination 24-inch\nstorm drain and open channel system conveys flow along the south side of\nMain Street discharging into St. Vrain Creek. An 18-inch storm drain\nconveys flow south from the Park Street and 2\nnd\n Avenue\nintersection into St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.9 Steamboat Valley\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nSteamboat Valley upstream of Vasquez Road\n\n\nThe Steamboat Valley watershed is located directly north of downtown,\nbounded by the Eagle Canyon Watershed to the west and to the east by the\nThird Avenue and Stone Canyon Watersheds. The majority of the 370 acre\nwatershed converges just upstream of downtown and is conveyed between\n4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Avenue. In the upper reaches, the\nwatershed consists of large lot residential and undeveloped properties.\nThe lower third of the watershed is fully developed consisting of\nresidential and commercial lots. In the lower downtown area the\nwatershed is bounded by 4\nth\n Avenue to the east and North St.\nVrain Creek to the west. The watershed ranges in elevation from 6520\nfeet to 5335 feet.\n\n\n \n\nSteamboat Valley downstream of Vasquez Road\n\n\nThe flow concentrates in the upper reaches in an open channel with an\napproximate slope of 16 percent. The flow continues south into a private\ninadvertent storage area on the Russell property upstream of the old\nrailroad embankment. Downstream of the railroad embankment the\ndrainageway is confined in a small open channel that conveys flow\nthrough backyards of private property. There are several roadway\ncrossings within this reach including Vasquez Road, McCall Alley, Reese\nAvenue, Steward Avenue, and Stickney Avenue. A reportedly historic stone\nbox culvert intercepts flow and conveys flow underneath downtown until\nthe outfall location into North St. Vrain Creek. The slope is\napproximately four percent downstream of the railroad embankment.\n\n\n \n\nSteamboat Valley downstream of Seward Avenue\n\n\nAn 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe collects flow along\n5\nth\n Street south of Main Street to Park Drive. This pipe\nincreases in size just downstream of Park Drive to a 28-inch by 16-inch\nreinforced concrete elliptical pipe before discharging to North St.\nVrain Creek.\n\n\nAlong 4\nth\n Avenue an 18-inch reinforced concrete storm drain\npipe intercepts flow at Stickney Avenue and conveys the flow south to\nRailroad Avenue. At Railroad Avenue the storm drain increases in size to\na 24-inch reinforced concrete storm drain pipe continuing south to the\noutfall location into North St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.10 Stone Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nStone Canyon upstream of Stone Canyon Road\n\n\nThe Stone Canyon Watershed is located east of the Third Avenue and\nEastern Lyons Watersheds. In the upper reaches, the 1550 acre watershed\nis dominated by large residential and undeveloped properties. The open\nchannel which conveys the majority of the runoff for the Stone Canyon\nwatershed has an average slope of approximately four percent. The\nwatershed ranges in elevation from 6580 feet to 5294 feet.\n\n\nThe open channel drainageway passes through multiple roadway crossings\nwithin Boulder County. Within the Town of Lyons, Stone Canyon is\nconveyed underneath Stone Canyon Road through a 13 foot by 8 foot\nreinforced concrete box culvert. The drainage path continues south where\nflow is conveyed underneath Ute Highway through an 8 foot by 4 foot\nreinforced concrete box culvert into St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\n2.3.11 Third Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nThird Avenue downstream towards Main Street\n\n\nThe Third Avenue watershed, approximately 170 acres, conveys flow\nsouthwest into the downtown area along Third Avenue. The watershed is\nundeveloped upstream of the downtown area bounded by Steamboat Valley to\nthe west and Eastern Lyons and Stone Canyon. The watershed ranges in\nelevation from 6260 feet to 5320 feet. Development within the lower\nportions of the watershed is dominated by residential and commercial\ndevelopment. The watershed discharges flow into North St. Vrain Creek\njust upstream of the confluence with South St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\nAn existing 5 foot x 4 foot elliptical pipe conveys flow underneath Main\nStreet at Third Avenue into the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed.",

            "text": "3.0 Hydrologic Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\n3.1 Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor this study, a new hydrologic model was prepared for the Town of\nLyons. This purpose of this model was to develop updated hydrology for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year storm frequencies for both existing\nand future imperviousness. Similar to the 1998 BRW study, the UDFCD's\nColorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) was used to develop runoff\nhydrographs for each sub-basin in the study. However, with the recent\nrelease of CUHP v2.0 by the UDFCD, and that Lyons is located outside of\nthe UDFCD boundary, further investigations were made to confirm the\napplicability of the new CUHP software in comparison to other hydrologic\nmethods. The selection of the hydrologic model is discussed below.\n\n\nA full copy of the Hydrologic study is provided in \nAppendix B.\n\n\n3.2 Hydrologic Model\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo evaluate the latest version of CUHP (and other hydrologic methods)\nand to determine the appropriate model inputs, a peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis was conducted for a typical undeveloped sub-basin near the\nTown, using various hydrologic techniques. The following lists the\nhydrologic methods that were reviewed in the sensitivity analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Geologic Survey (USGS) Regional Regression Equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRational Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUHP 2005 Version 1.4.4 -- This is the more recent model used by\n    UDFCD (prior to the recent update) and has been used for over 40\n    years to estimate peak flows in the Denver metropolitan area and\n    front range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUHP Version 2.0 -- Recently the UDFCD has determined that peak\n    flows developed in recent hydrologic studies using CUHP 2005 version\n    1.4.4 deviated from statistical stream gage analysis across the\n    District and created uncertainty with CUHP model results for\n    some studies. Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods. Further documentation on\nthe hydrologic model recommendations can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\n3.3 Design Rainfall\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe design rainfall for the project was derived using the one-hour\nprecipitation depths from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) Atlas 14. One-hour point precipitation depths were\nbased on the centroid of the entire project area and were recorded for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year recurrence intervals. Point\nprecipitation depths for varying elevation within the project area were\nidentified, but point precipitation depth adjustments due to elevation\nwere not necessary since the difference in the one-hour precipitation\ndepths by elevation was less than 0.1 inches. Using the one-hour\nprecipitation depth, CUHP calculates the incremental depth for each time\nincrement from 5 to 120 minutes. Due to the smaller sizes of sub-basins,\nprecipitation depth-area reduction factors were not utilized. Table 3-1\nsummarizes the design rainfall depths for various recurrence intervals.\n\n\nTable 3-1: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Period\n\n\n\n\n1-Hr Rainfall Depth (in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-yr\n\n\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-yr\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-yr\n\n\n\n\n2.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Sub-basin Characteristics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basin characteristics for each basin are further described below and\ncan be found in \nAppendix A\n.\n\n\n3.4.1 Sub-basin Delineation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSub-basins were delineated using the 2011 LIDAR and associated 1-ft\ncontours. There is a total of 44 sub-basins within the project area. The\nundeveloped sub-basins located higher up in the watersheds are larger in\nsize than the sub-basins within the urbanized Town. Sub-basin sizes\nrange from 17 acres to 335 acres. \nAppendix A\n provides an overview of\nthe sub-basins.\n\n\n3.4.2 Length, Centroid Distance, Slope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCUHP parameters such as sub-basin length, distance to centroid, and\nslopes were derived for each sub-basin using topographic data. Slopes\nwere computed using the length-weighted, corrected average slope from\nUDFCD's Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM), including\ncorrections for stream and vegetated channels.\n\n\n3.4.3 Depression Losses\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe maximum pervious depression storage was set to the recommended value\nof 0.4 inches for wooded areas and open fields. The maximum impervious\ndepression storage was set to the recommended value of 0.1 inches. No\nadjustments were made to these recommended values.\n\n\n3.4.4 Infiltration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSoils data was obtained from USDA NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database\nfor the project area which classified the soils into Hydrologic Soils\nGroups (HSGs). Additional soils mapping was obtained from the USDA NRCS\nWeb Soil Survey. This information is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nThe initial rate, final rate, and decay coefficient for the Horton's\ninfiltration parameters were based on the recommended values in the\nUSDCM. The Horton's infiltration parameters were weighted based on the\npercentage of each soil type within each sub-basin. Table 3-2 summarizes\nthe Horton's infiltration parameters utilized in the analysis.\n\n\nTable 3-2: 1-hr Rainfall Depth\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInfiltration (inches per hour)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrologic Soil Group\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInitial - fi\n\n\n\n\nFinal - fo\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDecay Coefficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA/B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 CUHP Output\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe hydrologic analysis was conducted for both existing conditions and\nfuture conditions land use. The 100-year peak discharges from CUHP v2.0\nfor both conditions are presented in Table 3-3. CUHP output for other\nrecurrence intervals is provided in Appendix B.\n\n\nAlthough this hydrologic analysis did not calibrate peak flows to the\nprevious Town of Lyons Drainage Master Plan Final Report prepared by\nBRW, the CUHP unit rates of runoff were compared with the previous study\nunit rates of runoff for sub-basins that were similarly delineated. In\nsome cases, the unit rates of runoff are similar, but there are cases\nwhere the unit rates of runoff differ. These differences are primarily\ndue to physical differences in input assumptions (imperviousness, HSGs,\netc.).\n\n\nTable 3-3: CUHP Output, 100-Year\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubbasin\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nExisting Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions 100-Year Peak Discharge (cfs)\n\n\n\n\nFuture Conditions Unit Rate of Runoff (cfs/ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n408\n\n\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n534\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n449\n\n\n\n\n2.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n306\n\n\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n2.61\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n2.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n\n\n2.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n3.68\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n3.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n3.05\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n3.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n1.64\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n1.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n4.55\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n4.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n3.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n386\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n386\n\n\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n526\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n575\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n171\n\n\n\n\n2.19\n\n\n\n\n208\n\n\n\n\n2.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n2.33\n\n\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n2.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n387\n\n\n\n\n1.64\n\n\n\n\n393\n\n\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n2.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n370\n\n\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n161\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n161\n\n\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n199\n\n\n\n\n2.86\n\n\n\n\n234\n\n\n\n\n3.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n3.29\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n3.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\n\n359\n\n\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n\n\n359\n\n\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n\n\n144\n\n\n\n\n1.97\n\n\n\n\n145\n\n\n\n\n1.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n3.66\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n3.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n315\n\n\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n\n\n315\n\n\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\n\n136\n\n\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n\n\n136\n\n\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Hydrograph Routing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA hydrograph routing network was developed based on field\nreconnaissance, survey of the existing storm sewer network within Town,\nand the BRW, Inc. drainage master plan using EPA SWMM. The routing\nnetwork in EPA SWMM includes: nodes (junctions and dividers), conduits\n(including overflow or diverted links), storage units, storage outlets,\nand outfalls. The model input parameters for nodes include: node\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum node depth, and overflow or\ndiverted link identifier. Input parameters for conduits include: conduit\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, shape (e.g.\ntrapezoidal, circular, rectangular, etc.), length, bottom width, side\nslopes, roughness coefficient, number of barrels, and inlet/outlet\noffset depths. Input parameters for storage units include: storage unit\nidentifier, invert elevation, maximum depth, and a stage-area\nrelationship. Input parameters for storage outlets include: outlet\nidentifier, upstream and downstream node identifiers, and a\nstage-discharge relationship. Input parameters for outfalls include the\noutfall identifier and invert elevation. Input parameters for the SWMM\nmodel are provided in Appendix B.\n\n\n3.5.1 SWMM Node Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNode identifiers in SWMM are synonymous with the sub-basin IDs. Invert\nelevations were determined using the 2011 LIDAR data. In some instances,\na divider was used to allow the flow to be routed through the existing\nstorm sewer system but when the capacity of the storm sewer is exceeded,\nthe water overflows into the street (along 2nd Avenue south of E. Main\nStreet and near the intersection of Main Street and E. Main Street).\n\n\n3.5.2 SWMM Conduit Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor the drainage basins located outside of Town, transects of the\ndrainage channels were generated using the 2011 LIDAR and a\nrepresentative channel cross-section was input into the SWMM model. The\nmanning's roughness coefficient for these undeveloped drainage basins\nwas estimated to be 0.035 to represent channels with some weeds and\nstones.\n\n\nWithin the developed areas, characteristics of the drainage facilities\nwere based on survey of the existing storm sewer system, field\nreconnaissance, and sizing the channels so that the flow could\nadequately be conveyed to the outfall. Between 5th Avenue and 4th\nAvenue, there is an existing drainage ditch that varies in width and\ndepth but is enclosed downstream to accommodate development over the\nditch. For the purposes of the SWMM model, it was assumed to have a\nuniform width and depth. There is a small roadside swale with\nintermittent driveway and roadway culverts along the west side of 3rd\nAvenue. However, the swale and culverts have such limited capacity and\nduring large storm events, the water would flow down 3rd Avenue. At 3rd\nAvenue and Main Street there is a 30\" reinforced concrete pipe that\ndiverts flow from 3rd Avenue to the southeast along E. Main Street.\nDuring large storm events, the flow continues down within E. Main\nStreet, which was modeled as an open channel, until it discharges into\nthe St. Vrain Creek. South of E. Main Street along 2nd Avenue there is a\nstorm sewer system consisting of 18-inch, 12-inch, and 15-inch\ncorrugated metal pipe which discharges into the St. Vrain Creek. This\nstorm sewer system was modeled as a 12-inch pipe in the SWMM model.\n\n\nThere are many sub-basins which are direct flow areas into the North St.\nVrain Creek, South St. Vrain Creek, or St. Vrain Creek. Therefore, the\nconduits for these sub-basins were modeled as \"dummy\" conduits.\n\n\n3.5.3 SWMM Storage Input Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn existing detention pond is located within Sub-basin 1.5. The\nstage-area relationship was taken directly from the BRW, Inc. drainage\nmaster plan, as well as the stage-discharge relationship for the outlet.\nNo additional detention ponds were modeled for the existing conditions,\nalthough inadvertent storage and/or privately owned detention may\nelsewhere within the project area.\n\n\n3.5.4 SWMM Output\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe SWMM routing was conducted for both existing conditions and future\nconditions. The 100-year peak discharges at all of the outfalls from the\nSWMM model for both conditions are presented in Table 3-4. SWMM output\nfor other recurrence intervals is provided in \nAppendix J.\n\n\nTable 3-4: SWMM Output, 100-Year\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWMM Outfall Name\n\n\n\n\nRouted Subbasins\n\n\n\n\nReceiving

This purpose of this model was to develop updated hydrology for\nthe 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, and 100-year storm frequencies for both existing\nand future imperviousness. Similar to the 1998 BRW study, the UDFCD's\nColorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) was used to develop runoff\nhydrographs for each sub-basin in the study. However, with the recent\nrelease of CUHP v2.0 by the UDFCD, and that Lyons is located outside of\nthe UDFCD boundary, further investigations were made to confirm the\napplicability of the new CUHP software in comparison to other hydrologic\nmethods. The selection of the hydrologic model is discussed below.  A full copy of the Hydrologic study is provided in  Appendix B.",

The following lists the\nhydrologic methods that were reviewed in the sensitivity analysis:    United States Geologic Survey (USGS) Regional Regression Equations.    Rational Method.    CUHP 2005 Version 1.4.4 -- This is the more recent model used by\n    UDFCD (prior to the recent update) and has been used for over 40\n    years to estimate peak flows in the Denver metropolitan area and\n    front range.    CUHP Version 2.0 -- Recently the UDFCD has determined that peak\n    flows developed in recent hydrologic studies using CUHP 2005 version\n    1.4.4 deviated from statistical stream gage analysis across the\n    District and created uncertainty with CUHP model results for\n    some studies. Additionally, CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4 has not been\n    calibrated with gage data since its inception in the 1970s with\n    adjustments made in the 1980s. Therefore, UDFCD has recalibrated\n    CUHP with updated rainfall and runoff with results tested against\n    stream gage frequency analysis. However, it should be noted that\n    during the recalibration of CUHP, there were no watersheds with an\n    imperviousness less than 20 percent. Therefore, for sub-basins with\n    imperviousness below 20 percent, the peak flows are estimated using\n    similar methodology used in CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4.    HEC-HMS Model - using Curve Number method.    UDFCD Allowable Release Rates -- The UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual, Volume 2, Storage chapter provides pre-development\n    peak unit discharge rates for watersheds of various slopes and\n    Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that are utilized to determine the\n    maximum allowable 100-year release rates for a full spectrum\n    detention facility.    Based on the results of the undeveloped sub-basin peak flow sensitivity\nanalysis, CUHP version 2.0 was recommended for the hydrologic modeling\nfor the Lyons storm drainage master plan. The unit rates of runoff from\nCUHP version 2.0 were generally in the same range as those generated\nusing the Rational Method, in addition to the UDFCD allowable release\nrates. The unit rates of runoff generated using CUHP 2005 version 1.4.4\nwere higher than any of the other hydrologic methods which potentially\nwould overestimate the peak flows for the Town. The regional regression\nequations significantly underestimated the unit rates of runoff when\ncompared to the other hydrologic model methods.

Within the developed areas, characteristics of the drainage facilities\nwere based on survey of the existing storm sewer system, field\nreconnaissance, and sizing the channels so that the flow could\nadequately be conveyed to the outfall. Between 5th Avenue and 4th\nAvenue, there is an existing drainage ditch that varies in width and\ndepth but is enclosed downstream to accommodate development over the\nditch. For the purposes of the SWMM model, it was assumed to have a\nuniform width and depth. There is a small roadside swale with\nintermittent driveway and roadway culverts along the west side of 3rd\nAvenue.

            "text": "4.0 Hydraulic Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\n4.1 Previous Analysis and Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe information provided in the previous 1998 Drainage Master Plan study\nwas used to help identify flood hazards throughout the Town of Lyons.\nThe previous report identifies several key areas as having potential for\nflooding hazards. A few key events are highlighted for reference.\n\n\nIn the August 1994 flood the Ewald Avenue subwatershed was observed to\nproduce enough runoff to carry debris off the hillside onto the\nresidential streets.\n\n\nSteamboat Valley was identified as having the greatest impact to\nflooding throughout the Town of Lyons. The report indicated the\nSteamboat Valley Watershed was the hardest hit area during the 1994\nstorm. The existing storm drain system between 4\nth\n and\n5\nth\n Avenue was estimated to be an approximate 5-year storm\ncapacity. The storage behind the old railroad embankment was identified\nas an issue of major concern. The properties downstream of the railroad\nembankment have grown reliant on this detention and removal of this\ndetention would have negative impacts to downstream property owners.\nSeveral properties behind the railroad embankment were noted to be at\nrisk of flooding when the detention area was full.\n\n\nThe conveyance of Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff in South Ledge Ditch\nwas identified as a possible flooding hazard. The report noted the\npossibility of the ditch embankment to become compromised and the bank\nto be breached with the conveyance of storm water runoff. It should be\nnoted that Lyons Valley Subdivision was not constructed at the time of\nthe previous report.\n\n\nThe 2013 flood event had a well-documented impact on the Town of Lyons.\nThe confluence of the north and south St. Vrain Rivers was the center of\nflood damages during the 2013 floods. Several reports provide further\ndocumentation of the flood event. Numerous post-flood studies on the\nfloodplain and restoration projects are also available.\n\n\nA 2015 flood event was notable because of the hail associated with the\nstorm. The resulting hail-laden runoff clogged surface conveyance\n(streets, gutters) as well as capture systems (inlets, outlet\nstructures).\n\n\n4.2 Evaluation of Existing Facilities\n\uf0c1\n\n\nExisting storm drain infrastructure was evaluated to determine the\napproximate design storm frequency. A summary of existing infrastructure\nis provided in the GIS data provided in \nAppendix K. (or on web map\napplication at www...)\n\n\nFLO-2D software is a two-dimensional flood routing model that was used\nto identify residual flood potential with the watershed. FLO-2D\nsimulates channel flow, unconfined overland flow and street flow over\ncomplex topology. The model uses the full dynamic wave momentum equation\nand a central finite difference routing scheme with eight potential flow\ndirections to predict the progression of a floodwave over a system of\nsquare grid elements. The development of the FLO-2D model is further\ndiscussed below.\n\n\n4.2.1 Flo-2D Model Development\n\uf0c1\n\n\n10-foot by 10-foot grid cells were used to maximize the precision in\nidentifying flooding potential throughout the watershed. Elevations for\neach grid cell were computed through FLO-2D by interpolating the project\nLiDAR data. Building obstructions were incorporated into the FLO-2D\nmodel based on building footprint data that was generated as part of\nthis study.\n\n\nIndividual subwatershed hydrographs were taken from the hydrology model\n(CUHP) and applied to the FLO-2D surface. Each hydrograph was applied at\na single FLO-2D grid cell where the majority of discharges were expected\nto converge for each subwatershed. Existing storm drain systems 24-inch\nand larger were included in the FLO-2D model.\n\n\nSeparate FLO-2D models were used to distinguish the flooding potential\nfor the study area for each of the design storms.\n\n\nThe results of these models are provided in \nAppendix D\n. (And also on\nthe web map at www...)\n\n\n4.3 Flood Hazards\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFLO-2D uses the full dynamic wave momentum equation when computing flow\ndepth at each cell in the study area. This computational methodology\naccounts for floodplain storage at each sump location in the watershed\nattenuating flows as they traverse the watershed downstream. This\nfloodplain storage is not accounted for in the SWMM model which is\ncomputed using a kinematic wave approach. This difference in modeling\napproach leads to discrepancies when comparing design peak flows from\nthe SWMM model and the inundation limits shown in the hydraulic\nanalysis. Existing capacity for each outfall system was estimated from\nnormal depth calculations given each pipe slope. The existing storm\ndrain infrastructure generally lacks the capacity to adequately convey\nthe 5-year storm event.\n\n\nThis is not unusual for a town the age and size of the Town of Lyons.\nLand use regulations and stormwater management policies were not common\nto smaller towns along the Front Range of Colorado until sometime after\nthe 1965 flood on the South Platte River ravaged metro Denver. By the\ntime development regulation and stormwater infrastructure\nrecommendations expanded to include smaller towns along the Front Range,\na lot of Lyons' roadways and private development had encroached on the\nnatural drainageways.\n\n\n4.3.1 Eagle Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most significant flooding hazard in the Eagle Canyon Watershed is\njust upstream of the confluence with North St. Vrain Creek. Development\nimmediately upstream of the confluence has limited the capacity of the\nchannel. By limiting the ability of the channel to convey water to North\nSt. Vrain, the discharge overtops Main Street and spills to the south.\n\n\n4.3.2 Eastern Lyons\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe small swale and private roadway culverts along the east side of\n2\nnd\n Avenue limit the capacity to convey the basin runoff\ndownstream. With no storm drain or curb and gutter system installed\nalong 2\nnd\n Avenue, all basin runoff will flow along\n2\nnd\n Avenue on the street. As mentioned previously, during\nmajor events runoff from the Eastern Lyons watershed any flow\novertopping 2\nnd\n Avenue will flow west and contribute flow to\nthe Third Avenue Watershed.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of Eastern Lyons Watershed the businesses along\nMain Street and residences along Kelling Drive have experienced flooding\nin the past. The only storm drain intercepting flow near the businesses\nis an 18-inch storm drain. This system can capture less than the 5-year\ndesign flow in ideal, free flow, no debris conditions.\n\n\n4.3.3 Ewald Ave\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs noted in the previous study, the steep slopes of the Ewald Ave\nWatershed pose a flooding hazard to the residential development in the\nlower portions of the watershed. The steep slopes in the upper portion\nof the watershed result in high velocities of runoff eroding the\nhillside and carrying debris into the residential development.\n\n\nThe Boulder County open space borders these properties and constrains\nthe range of solutions for intercepting or diverting these flows.\nHowever, the lower end of this basin drains well into the confluence\narea of North and South St. Vrain rivers.\n\n\n4.3.4 Lyons Valley Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the Lyons Valley Park Watershed are a result of\ndevelopment within the basin without adequate storm drain conveyance.\nThe 18-inch storm drain throughout the upper reaches of the development\nwas not designed to convey major storm events.\n\n\nA significant flooding hazard for the Lyons Valley Park Watershed is\noverflow from the Red Hill Gulch Watershed. The overflow drainage path\nfrom Red Hill Gulch is discussed in further detail below.\n\n\nAn overflow path from the hillside south of the High School, Ledge Ditch\nsub-basin, is an interesting problem. The modeling scenarios do not\naccount for the irrigation ditch that traverses the hillside near the\ntoe of slope. This is a common hydraulic modeling assumption to account\nfor a runoff event during a ditch full scenario. However, in a practical\nsense the irrigation ditch catches most minor storm events and\neffectively protects the adjacent residential structures. At a minimum,\nthe ditch should be monitored for stability to ensure overflows and\nspills from stormwater are handled safely. Additional planning for a\ntime when the ditch is no longer operational or maintained should be\nconsidered. Finally, protection or enhancement of the minor swale along\nthe rear lot lines of the neighborhood should be considered to ensure\nsheet flows are passed around the structures.\n\n\n4.3.5 North St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the North St. Vrain Watershed are limited to the\nlower end of the basin. Generally flows in this basin concentrate in\nnatural valleys and are conveyed overland towards the St. Vrain River.\nLand use changes in this area have limited the flood risk significantly.\n\n\n4.3.6 Red Hill Gulch\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nFlows exceeding the capacity of the South Ledge Ditch continue north in an unconfined flow path\n\n\nThe most significant flooding hazard in the Red Hill Gulch Watershed is\nflow overtopping the South Ledge Ditch and flow continuing north into\nBohn Park and Lyons Valley Subdivision. As noted above, utilizing the\nditch for intercepting and conveying stormwater runoff creates a\nsignificant hazard for downstream properties. These comingled flows\nexceed the design capacity of the canal jeopardizing the structural\nintegrity of the ditch. Flows overtopping the ditch create an\nuncontrolled overflow impacting Bohn Park and homes in the Lyons Valley\nSubdivision.\n\n\nThe surface flows from Red Hill Gulch follow an ancient alluvial fan\npattern starting at the intersection of Red Hill Gulch Road and Jasper\nDrive and extending north towards the South St. Vrain. The surface flows\ngenerally follow Red Hill Gulch Road north until it turns west, the\nsurface flows continue north east of a high point on County Road 69.\nThis is an interesting key point in the surface drainage conditions of\nRed Hill Gulch because the surface flows are so close to the South St.\nVrain, but instead follow a natural topographic low point\neast-northeast. This ultimately leads to a flow path intersecting with\nLyons Valley subdivision and the newly planned Bohn Park.\n\n\n4.3.7 South St. Vrain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlooding hazards in the South St. Vrain Watershed are generally created\nby the lack of a formal drainage conveyance system. The topography\nwithin these watersheds conveys the runoff in separate flow paths to\nSouth St. Vrain Creek. The flow paths are generally shallow native grass\nand rock swales with minimal impact to private property or public\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n4.3.8 South 2nd Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFlood hazards within the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed are\ncaused by contributing flow from other watersheds, lack of local runoff\nstorm drain conveyance, and proximity to St. Vrain Creek. The elliptical\npipe underneath Main Street conveys runoff from the Third Avenue\nWatershed to the South 2\nnd\n Avenue Watershed. The pipe\ndischarges flow into an undersized open channel that conveys flow\nsoutheast towards 2\nnd\n Avenue. Any flow that is not\nintercepted by the 24-inch storm drain at 2\nnd\n Avenue spills\nto the south impacting properties. The 18-inch storm drain at\n2\nnd\n Avenue and Park Street intercepts approximately the XX\ndesign flow for the subwatershed, impacting more properties.\n\n\n4.3.9 Steamboat Valley\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\nExisting Steamboat Valley channel lacks conveyance capacity\n\n\nThe most significant flood hazard impacting downtown Lyons is runoff\nfrom Steamboat Valley. The runoff from the upper watershed concentrates\nbehind the old railroad embankment. The area behind the old railroad\nembankment poses a significant flood hazard to downstream properties.\nClose observation on the stability and maintenance of this embankment is\nimportant to managing the risk of a breach or other failure during a\nstorm event. This will require coordination with several private\nproperty owners. Downstream of the railroad embankment development\nwithin the natural drainage path has confined the runoff to an\nundersized open channel through private property. The lack of conveyance\ncapacity of this channel and culvert roadway crossings between\n4\nth\n Avenue and 5\nth\n Avenue creates a flooding\nhazard damaging private property. Any flow that is not intercepted by\nthe historic stone culvert continues on the surface flowing through\nbackyards with additional impact to private property and structures.\n\n\n \n\nSteamboat Valley at Reese Street between 4th and 5th Avenue\n\n\nThe existing conveyance within Steamboat Valley does not have the\nhydraulic capacity to convey storms greater than the 5-year return\nperiod. More importantly, the materials (stone and open channel) and\nalignment (erratic with several sharp bends and constrictions) subjects\nthe adjacent properties to additional risk from debris clogging.\n\n\n4.3.10 Stone Canyon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe steep natural drainageway in the Stone Canyon Watershed conveys the\nrunoff into the open space of the Stone Canyon Subdivision without\nsignificant flood hazards. The roadway crossing at Stone Canyon Road\nconveys the flow downstream without impacting a significant number of\nresidences within the subdivision. Development downstream of Stone\nCanyon Road has eliminated the conveyance capacity of the channel to\nconvey runoff without impacting properties. The water backs up against\nUte Highway as water is conveyed underneath the roadway through the box\nculvert.\n\n\nThere have been reports of soil subsidence in the open space areas\nadjacent to the channel. This study did not include detailed\ngeotechnical analysis to determine a cause or effect of the reported\nsoil movement. More formal identification of the problem areas, formal\nand regular monitoring of those sites, and geotechnical analysis would\nbe required to properly evaluate the risk of those soils relative to\nflood hazards (i.e. bank failure reducing channel capacity), private, or\npublic property.\n\n\n4.3.11 Third Avenue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRunoff from the undeveloped upper watershed enters the downtown in two\ndistinct locations. East of the cemetery flow drains south into the\ndeveloped area of the watershed along Third Avenue. Flow from the\neastern portion of the watershed flows into the downtown area west along\nStickney Avenue before turning south on Third Avenue. The runoff from\nthe watershed continues south along Third Avenue where the majority of\nthe flow is conveyed in the street. The elliptical pipe at Main Street\nconveys flow underneath Main Street into the South 2\nnd\n Avenue\nWatershed. Flows exceeding the capacity of the elliptical pipe split\nwith some flow continuing southeast north of Main Street while some flow\novertops Main Street and continues flowing down Third Street.",

A few key events are highlighted for reference.  In the August 1994 flood the Ewald Avenue subwatershed was observed to\nproduce enough runoff to carry debris off the hillside onto the\nresidential streets.  Steamboat Valley was identified as having the greatest impact to\nflooding throughout the Town of Lyons. The report indicated the\nSteamboat Valley Watershed was the hardest hit area during the 1994\nstorm. The existing storm drain system between 4 th  and\n5 th  Avenue was estimated to be an approximate 5-year storm\ncapacity. The storage behind the old railroad embankment was identified\nas an issue of major concern. The properties downstream of the railroad\nembankment have grown reliant on this detention and removal of this\ndetention would have negative impacts to downstream property owners.\nSeveral properties behind the railroad embankment were noted to be at\nrisk of flooding when the detention area was full.  The conveyance of Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff in South Ledge Ditch\nwas identified as a possible flooding hazard. The report noted the\npossibility of the ditch embankment to become compromised and the bank\nto be breached with the conveyance of storm water runoff. It should be\nnoted that Lyons Valley Subdivision was not constructed at the time of\nthe previous report.  The 2013 flood event had a well-documented impact on the Town of Lyons.\nThe confluence of the north and south St. Vrain Rivers was the center of\nflood damages during the 2013 floods. Several reports provide further\ndocumentation of the flood event. Numerous post-flood studies on the\nfloodplain and restoration projects are also available.  A 2015 flood event was notable because of the hail associated with the\nstorm. The resulting hail-laden runoff clogged surface conveyance\n(streets, gutters) as well as capture systems (inlets, outlet\nstructures).",

The flooding\ndepicted on this map is a uniform storm event across all watersheds at\nthe same period of time and same duration.\n\n\nFree flow. These depths do not account for debris or hail or other\nimpediments in storm water conveyance systems. Debris flow modeling is\npossible, but is beyond the scope of this master plan study.\n\n\nStorm sewer systems. Small diameter storm sewer systems were not\naccounted for in the hydraulic modeling and resulting floodplain mapping\nfor this master plan study. The impact of a 4 or 8-inch or even 18-inch\nculvert on flood depths is limited when considering storm events beyond\nthe 2 year recurrence interval. As a sensitivity analysis, the 18-inch\nstorm sewer pipes and inlets were accounted for in the Lyons Village\narea. The resulting flood depths were unchanged for all but the 2 year\nrecurrence interval. In the 2 year recurrence interval storm, the flood\ndepths were reduced by approximately 3 inches. The floodplain mapping is\ndrawn as a quilt of interlocking 10 foot squares with depth averaged\nacross that area. There were less than 40 squares (4,000 square feet)\nremoved from flooding when accounting for the 18-inch storm sewer.\n\n\nIt is important to note, this is not a referendum on the existing\n18-inch storm sewer system. Clearly, an 18-inch storm sewer conveys\nwater and a has a beneficial impact on the flood risk in the\nneighborhood. This is a clear indication of the limitations of master\nplan level, town wide, flood risk mapping. The uncertainty variables at\nthe master plan level results in floodplain maps depicting general,\nconservative areas of risk. When areas such as developed neighborhoods\nwith existing storm sewer systems show up on the master plan flood maps\nattention should be given to determine if a higher level of study is\nnecessary. In the case of Lyons Valley, the storm is functional and\nclearly benefits the properties more than the master plan flood hazard\nmaps indicate. However, when combined with anecdotal stories about\nspring and summer street flooding from overwhelmed inlets, this may be\nan area to consider for additional detailed field survey and hydraulic\nanalysis.\n\n\n5.3 Regulatory Floodplains\n\uf0c1\n\n\nConversion of these flood hazard areas to regulatory floodplains is a\ncomplicated, long, but well documented process. At this time, the master\nplan makes no specific recommendation for submitting these floodplain\ndelineations to FEMA for formal adoption.

The impact of a 4 or 8-inch or even 18-inch\nculvert on flood depths is limited when considering storm events beyond\nthe 2 year recurrence interval. As a sensitivity analysis, the 18-inch\nstorm sewer pipes and inlets were accounted for in the Lyons Village\narea. The resulting flood depths were unchanged for all but the 2 year\nrecurrence interval. In the 2 year recurrence interval storm, the flood\ndepths were reduced by approximately 3 inches. The floodplain mapping is\ndrawn as a quilt of interlocking 10 foot squares with depth averaged\nacross that area. There were less than 40 squares (4,000 square feet)\nremoved from flooding when accounting for the 18-inch storm sewer.  It is important to note, this is not a referendum on the existing\n18-inch storm sewer system. Clearly, an 18-inch storm sewer conveys\nwater and a has a beneficial impact on the flood risk in the\nneighborhood.

            "text": "6.0 Alternative Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.1 Alternative Development Process\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn Alternative Analysis was completed to develop flood mitigation\nsolutions for the problem areas identified in the previous section.\nGoals for mitigation focused on solutions to reducing flooding on\ninsurable structures. Consideration was also given to reducing\ninfrastructure sizing and costs by incorporating detention.\n\n\nAlternatives were considered first for open channel and then for piped\nsystems. Open channels are more cost effective, provide additional\necological benefits, mimic or sometimes restore the natural environment,\nbut require additional stabilization and maintenance to provide long\nterm benefits. Piped systems are far more hydraulically efficient and\nallow for more flexible land uses in and around the system, but do not\nbenefit the natural environment and can be significantly more costly to\ninstall, particularly in underlying rock soils.\n\n\nFor example, the development of downtown Lyons over the historic\ndrainageway has limited the ability to convey the major storm events\nthrough an open channel system. Since an open channel system is not\nfeasible, large storm drain infrastructure is needed to reduce the flood\nhazards throughout the study area. The storm drain infrastructure must\nlimit the amount of flow in the street to provide emergency vehicles\naccess during storm events.\n\n\nThe analysis aimed to develop stormwater solutions first within the Town\nof Lyons. When those alternatives were exhausted as cost prohibitive or\nunfeasible, then the project team considered alternatives outside of the\nTown limits. The cost of land acquisition, land use regulations, and\nextra-territorial jurisdiction can add significant costs to stormwater\nprojects outside of the Town limits. Conversely, knowing about potential\nout of town solutions to in-town risks can be prudent to future planning\nexercises in annexation, development referrals, and multi-agency\ncoordination.\n\n\n6.2 Criteria and Constraints\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs noted above, goals for the baseline alternative plan was to provide storm\ndrainage capacity to meeting currently defined drainage criteria set forth in\nthe Town of Lyons Storm Drainage System Criteria. The minor storm frequency\nfor the Town of Lyons is the 2-yr design storm. The major storm frequency for\nthe Town of Lyons is classified as the 100-yr design storm frequency. The\nonly inlet type allowed on streets is CDOT Type R inlets.\n\n\n6.3 Evaluation of Detention\n\uf0c1\n\n\n6.3.1 Detention\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetention is a common approach to reduce peak flows, optimize pipe size,\nand save on downstream infrastructure costs. Review of the previous\nmaster plan confirmed that previously master planned detention\nfacilities were drafted to meet this goal. If detention is installed in\nthe upper watersheds of the Town, there is a significant cost savings to\ndownstream stormwater infrastructure. However, upon closer examination\nof the previous master plan assumptions, field inspection of the\nproposed detention sites, and conceptual pond grading and layout there\nwere additional constraints on the detention pond locations.\n\n\n6.3.2 Steep Topography\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe steep slopes on the north end of Steamboat drainage require\nsignificant grading operations to achieve a functional detention volume\neven approaching 0.5 acre feet. This fact alone may still be a viable\nalternative since excavation is generally less expensive than long\nlengths of large storm sewer pipe material, utility crossings, and\ninstallation. However, given the geology of the upper Steamboat drainage\nthe depth to bedrock is known to be very shallow in many locations. Rock\nexcavation for a detention facility is prohibitively expensive.\nExcavation of the rock in a quarry scenario would be one economically\nviable means of providing sufficient detention volume at a reasonable\ncost for Steamboat drainage.\n\n\n6.3.3 Multiple Hillside Ponds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStaged detention facilities staggered in stair-step fashion up the steep slopes\nis another alternative to achieve the benefits of detention without significant\nexcavation. However, the extensive footprint of disturbance for multiple\nembankments, overflow spillway design, and permanent impact on property makes\nthis a challenging alternative.  If future development, annexation, and\nstormwater infrastructure funding allows this alternative can be studied in\ngreater detail.  For the immediate future, this is a difficult alternative to\nconsider for near term funding.\n\n\n6.3.4 Property Acquisition\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe natural valleys between 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Streets\nand 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n Streets could provide suitable\ndetention facilities if several existing constraints are mitigated.\nFirst, the private homes in the adjacent parcels would be impacted by\ndetention depths of more than approximately 5 feet. Purchase and\ndemolition of homes affected by a proposed detention facility would be\nrequired to achieve a useful detention volume. Second, the existing\nembankments between 4\nth\n and 5\nth\n Street should be\nreconstructed to replace the rock and native soils that were used to\nbuild what is reported to be an old railroad embankment. Until the\ncompaction and stability of that embankment can be verified, it should\nnot be relied upon to safely detain stormwater. It is unclear what the\noverflow path may be should the outlet under the embankment fail,\ncollapse or clog. However it is likely the overflow could lead to\nadditional erosion and scour of the embankment flanks and expedite\ncomplete failure of the embankment. Third, the valleys near the cemetery\nare also candidates for detention, but the steep slopes make each valley\nindividually difficult to achieve a reasonable volume. However, purchase\nof a uniquely shaped parcel of land slicing between the valleys could\nallow an embankment to be constructed that joins the two valleys and\ncreates a reasonable detention volume.\n\n\n6.4 Alternative Categories\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor the purpose of this study, alternatives were generally developed to\nmitigate the flooding hazards identified in Section 5.0. Specific details\nrelated to individual alternatives follow in subsequent report sections.\n\n\n6.5 Alternative Hydraulics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlternatives were modeled using EPA SWMM to determine the size of the\nstructures necessary to convey the design flow. The reduction in flooding\npotential throughout the basin was evaluated for the minor and major design\nstorm frequencies using FLO-2D.\n\n\n6.6 Alternative Costs\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlternative cost estimates were developed using UDFCD's master planning\ncost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. 2012 unit cost\nvalues were adjusted to present value using the Colorado Construction\nCost Index 2016 Second Quarter Report. A rolling four-quarter inflation\nrate of 1.2673 was used to adjust unit costs.\n\n\nOperation and Maintenance was also included within the UD MP Cost worksheet.\nMaintenance to remove sediment and debris and conduct structural repairs on\nstorm drain manholes and inlets was assumed to occur one every year.\nMaintenance to remove tree and weeds and sediment and debris in open channel\nalternatives was also assumed to occur once every year. Costs for maintenance\nof the hydraulic drops for the Red Hill Gulch West Channel was assumed to\noccur once a year.\n\n\nInlet quantities were calculated assuming an inlet interception capacity\nof 1 cfs / foot of inlet.\n\n\nDewatering, Traffic Control and Utility Coordination / Relocation were\nassigned based on the following percentages of capital costs: Dewatering\n(1%), Traffic Control (5%), Utility Coordination / Relocation (10%).\n\n\nSpecial items that were added to the UD-MP COST spreadsheet include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsphalt Repaving: $40 / S.Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurb and Gutter: $30 / L.F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo alterations were made to default values calculated as a percent of\nCapital Improvement Costs, such as Engineering, Legal / Administrative,\nContract Administration / Construction Management, and Contingency.\n\n\n6.7 Alternative Plans\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA - Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel East\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nRed Hill Gulch Overflow Channel East would intercept flows\n\nbefore diverting runoff into Lyons Valley Park Subdivision\n\n\nA diversion channel west of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision is proposed to\nintercept overflow from Red Hill Gulch before the discharge damages property.\nAny flow exceeding the capacity of the South Ledge Ditch continues north\nspilling into Bohn Park and Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. This uncontrolled\nspill flow risks the structural integrity of the ditch and poses a hazard to\nhomes along the west side of Lyons Valley Park. The Red Hill Gulch Overflow\nChannel East would intercept flows along the east side of Bohn Park preventing\nthese flows from diverting into the Lyons Valley Park Subdivision. The grading\nassociated with the overflow channel would change the surface conditions of\nthe east side of the park but still allow for parking and multi-purpose uses.\nThe multiple uses of this eastern side of the park require the channel to be\nwider and flatter that typical conveyance channels in order to maintain the\nfunction of the space for parking and exhibitions.\n\n\nIn general, this option intercepts and conveys large storm events from\nRed Hill Gulch before those flows encroach on private property. The\nalignment utilizes existing town property and requires no additional\neasements or property acquisition.\n\n\nHowever, this alternative compromises existing functions of the park\nland and assumes upstream development will not have an impact on the\ndrainage conditions. In other words, solving the Red Hill Gulch drainage\nthis far down in the watershed costs a lot when compared to what\nupstream alternatives may do to reduce stormwater impacts.\n\n\nB - Red Hill Gulch Overflow Channel West\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn alternative to the east channel at the downstream end of the\nwatershed is a western channel. When the Western Corridor is annexed\ninto the Town of Lyons the overflow channel alignment should be\nevaluated to intercept the flows upstream of Bohn Park eliminating any\ndisturbance to the park. The flows would be conveyed west of Bohn Park\nand discharged into South St. Vrain Creek. This is a smaller channel\nused for a singular stormwater purpose \u2013 it does not have to share uses\nwith a park or parking lot. The western alignment also conveys water\naround Bohn Park and Lyons Valley subdivision.\n\n\nHowever, the channel would require an easement or land acquisition from\nthe adjoining land owners. And, because of the smaller footprint, the\nhydraulics of the channel require drop structures to control erosive\nvelocities.\n\n\nC - Red Hill Gulch Cut-Off Channel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOutside of the Town, there is another problem area and option for\nmanaging Red Hill Gulch stormwater runoff.\n\n\nA third alternative for Red Hill Gulch drainage intercepts the gulch\nflows at the Picture Rock Trailhead and diverts those flows west into\nthe South St. Vrain. This alternative has the advantage of working a\nstormwater solution upstream of existing development and mitigating\nflood risk as high up in the watershed as feasible. This is the most\nhydraulically efficient alternative in that the diversion distance to\nthe South St. Vrain is short and the diversion volume is reduced when\ncompared to downstream alternatives.\n\n\nHowever, the constraints on this alternative are compounded by the need\nfor easement or land acquisition on both public and county open space\nproperty. The details of a diversion in this location will require\ncareful design and analysis. The surface flows are spread over a large\narea, but the right grading could allow just enough water to drain north\nthrough the park area and intercept the remainder to safely divert it\nwest to the South St. Vrain. Easements and reconstruction of Red Gulch\nRoad would be required. Existing irrigation ditches in the area compound\nproblems rerouting surface flows. Any diversion would still have to\ncross Ledge Ditch and Meadow Ditch.\n\n\nThere are several roadside ditches and ditch crossings that should be\ninvestigated further. The stormwater flows into Ledge and Meadow ditches\ncomplicate the flow paths for this drainage. Upstream and downstream of\nthe irrigation ditches, the roadside swales are an important part of\nconveying stormwater but need to be maintained to ensure positive\ndrainage away from the roadway.\n\n\nD - Steamboat Drainage Culvert Replacement\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe historic flowpath of Steamboat Valley Watershed conveys flow south\nbetween Fourth and Fifth Avenue through private property. The existing\nconfined channel and culvert roadway crossings could be replaced with a\nreinforced concrete box culvert conveying the entire 100-year design flow.\nThe proposed culvert replacement along the existing alignment uses the natural\ntopography to convey the runoff to the new culvert. However, implementing\nthis alternative would require extensive easements as the historic culvert\nruns through the downtown area underneath development on private properties.\n\n\nE - Steamboat Drainage Interceptors\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Steamboat Drainage Interceptor Alternative proposes to intercept flow just\ndownstream of the private railroad embankment at McCalley Alley. Flows in\nexcess of the existing channel and roadway crossing capacity would be\nintercepted and conveyed west to Fifth Avenue. The storm drain system would\ncontinue south where the system would outfall into North St. Vrain Creek.\nThis alternative proposes a lateral in Fourth Avenue from Stickney Avenue to\nNorth St. Vrain Creek to intercept local runoff in the lower portions of the\nSteamboat Valley Watershed.\n\n\nF - Third Avenue Inlets and Storm Drain\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo mitigate flood hazards associated with the Third Avenue Watershed, a storm\ndrain is proposed along Third Avenue from Cemetry Circle to North St. Vrain\nCreek. A lateral along Stickney Avenue is proposed to intercept flow from the\neast as it enters the residential area. Continuing the storm drain system\nsouth of Main Street would mitigate some of the flooding hazards within the\nSouth Second Avenue Watershed. Any flows in excess of the existing storm\ndrain in the Third Avenue Watershed currently spill in the South 2nd Avenue\nWatershed impacting properties.\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that excavation in the northern end of\nthe Third Avenue basin is likely to encounter rock and other earthwork\ncomplications. Depth of inlets and storm sewers will be limited by\nexcavation cost, which limits the hydraulic head and increases pipe\nsize. As pipe size increases, depth to cover the pipe must increase and\nbecome a costly design loop to determine a feasible storm sewer\nalignment.\n\n\nG - Lower 3\nrd\n Avenue Inlet\n\uf0c1\n\n\nExcess surface flows on 3\nrd\n Avenue could be conveyed to a\nlarge storm sewer inlet at the existing storm sewers on the southeast\ncorner of 3\nrd\n and Broadway. The existing grated inlets on the\nwest flowline of 3\nrd\n Avenue at Main Street could be improved,\nbut flows exceeding the capacity of those inlets will continue south on\n3\nrd\n Avenue. The proposed lower 3\nrd\n Avenue inlets\nwould capture flows from both gutter flowlines to maintain safe street\ncapacity on the south end of 3\nrd\n Avenue during storm events.\n\n\nThe west flowline is also one of the locations where surface flows could\nbe routed through a minor storm weir into a small volume water quality\npond in the east end of Sandstone Park. The pond would treat \u2018first\nflush' or the initial runoff volume with larger flows continuing south.\n\n\nH - Third Avenue Drainage Interceptors\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSimilar to the Steamboat drainage alternative, the surface conveyance on\nThird Avenue could be improved instead of excavation and installation of\ninlets and pipes. The surface conveyance improvement contains flows\nwithin the Town ROW, gutters, and directs flow south to the river. This\nreduces many of the overflows into private property that exceed the\nexisting roadway swales or smaller curbs. This alternative also reduces\nsurface flows intercepted at cross street intersections that drain water\ninto private property and complicate street flows entering Steamboat\ndrainage.\n\n\nThis alternative does not resolve major storm overflows. The minor\nstorms are handled with the interceptor gutters and cross pans. However,\nwhen those conveyance paths are at capacity, the overflow will continue\ndown the natural topography. An inlet and pipe system could be sized to\nconvey a much larger portion of the major storm event. But, as a\nrelatively low cost alternative, the benefits are tangible.\n\n\nI - Eastern Lyons - Second Avenue Gutter Interceptor\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRecent development within the Eastern Lyons watershed has increased the\nrunoff from the hillside causing local flooding problems. For larger\nevents the existing roadway conveyance and roadside swale along 2nd\nAvenue does not adequately convey the runoff south along 2nd Avenue\ninstead diverting flow to the west into the Third Avenue Watershed.\nFormalizing the street conveyance by installing curb and gutters and\ncross pans in 2nd Avenue would encourage runoff from this watershed to\ncontinue south along 2nd Avenue and not impact properties the Third\nAvenue Watershed.\n\n\nJ - Eastern Lyons - Second Avenue Inlets and Storm Sewer\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo ensure no runoff diverts from the Eastern Lyons Watershed, inlets and a\nstorm drain pipe can be installed along 2nd Avenue. The storm drain inlets and\npipe in combination with curb and gutter would intercept the flow and convey\nthe flow south to Main Street. South of Main Street the storm drain would\nconvey runoff to the Second Avenue and Park Street intersection before turning\neast to the outfall location into the St. Vrain Creek.\n\n\nK - Lyons Valley Inlet Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRunoff from the upper portions of the subwatershed sheet flows in a general\nnortheast direction through the subdivision to St. Vrain Creek. The storm\ndrain infrastructure installed with the development of Lyons Valley Park\nSubdivision is a minor drainage system and lacks capacity to convey major\nstorm events. This alternative proposes to increases the storm drain along the\nexisting alignment to convey the design flow for the 100-year storm.\n\n\nL - Lyons Valley South Ditch Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe South Ledge Ditch located south of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision\nintercepts runoff from the subwatershed. Formalizing the ditch to convey\nstormwater east towards St. Vrain Creek would reduce the tributary area\ncontributing to the flooding hazards of Lyons Valley Park Subdivision.\n\n\nThis alternative should be developed in coordination with the future\ndevelopment of Lyons Valley. A drainage feature around the south end of\nthe currently platted lots would benefit the new construction as well as\nthe existing homes in the neighborhood.\n\n\nThe greatest limitation of this alternative is the operation and\nmaintenance of the irrigation ditch and the coordination with any future\ndevelopment. Breaches and overtopping of the existing ditch are likely\nto continue to occur given the earthern embankment construction of the\nditch. As the platted future development moves into the final plan\napproval process, careful coordination should identify the benefits to\nboth existing and future homes in the area. And, when the cost of\nperimeter surface water conveyance (i.e. swale) is compared to sizing\ninterior storm inlets and pipes sized to safely capture and convey the\noffsite flows, the cost-benefit should resolve any further limitations\nof the concept.\n\n\nM - Lyons Valley McConnel Drive Culvert\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe impervious area of the school campus leads to nuisance drainage\nissues along McConnel Drive. It is unclear how the stormwater runoff is\ntreated within the school campus, but the roof drains and parking along\nthe east side of the campus are direct discharge to the west gutter of\nMcConnel Drive. On-site water quality and detention facilities, perhaps\nconversion of part of the irrigated turf areas, would collect, treat,\nand attenuate on-site discharges. A pond near the northeast corner of\nthe site could connect to a new underground storm sewer tied into the\nType R inlets at 2\nnd\n Avenue. This would move surface flow,\nparticularly nuisance flows dribbling winter melt water that freezes\novernight, into the on-site pond and underground, safely conveyed in a\npipe system.\n\n\nN - Ewald Ave - Corona Hill Diversion Ditch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs witnessed in the 1994 event, the Ewald Avenue Watershed poses a\nsignificant flooding hazard to downstream properties within the\nwatershed. High velocity runoff flow off Corona Hill can carry debris\ninto the residential neighborhood. Intercepting the flow upstream of the\ndevelopment and conveying the flow to the south would prevent debris\nflow from impacting private properties. The diversion channel south of\nthe development would require significant energy dissipation to prevent\nthe discharge from reaching high velocities and eroding the hillside\nsouth of the development. The steep slopes along the hillside would make\nconstruction of any diversion channel difficult.\n\n\nO - Ewald Ave - Corona Hill Street Inlets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn alternative to intercepting flows upstream of the residential development\nis formalizing street conveyance and installing storm drain infrastructure\nalong Prospect Road. The storm drain infrastructure in combination with curb\nand gutter improvements would confine the runoff from Corona Hill to the\nstreet limiting the impact to private properties. The storm drain system would\ncontinue east along Prospect Road to the confluence area between North and\nSouth St. Vrain Creek\n\n\nP - 2\nnd\n Avenue \u2013 Kelling Drive Private Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are past stormwater runoff events that have led to private\nproperty damages (fencing, landscaping, and structural flooding).\nMagnitude of the damages has not be investigated as part of this study.\nThe subject properties, residential structures on the north side of\nKelling Drive and commercial structures on the south side of Kelling\nDrive, are near the bottom of a steep southwestern facing slope. Runoff\nfrom the upstream property impervious area is controlled through\ndownspouts, gutters, landscape swales, street gutters, and storm sewer\nsystems.\n\n\nThe northern properties appear to have all or most of their foundations\nabove adjacent grade, positive drainage away from the structure.\nHowever, additional property line swales could convey surface flows\naround the structures. The southern properties appear to have adverse\ndrainage slopes near the building and could benefit from more formalized\ndrain pans along top or toe of the retaining walls on the north side of\nthe property. An existing grated inlet in the north flowline of Kelling\nDrive could be improved to increase surface water capture, but only\nreduces surface flows already in the street.\n\n\nSupport from the Town in terms of permitting, review, and easement\nterminology could resolve drainage issues in the vicinity of Kelling\nDrive. The installation of swales, inlets, pipes, moving existing\noutbuildings, and re-landscaping perimeter swales on each of the\naffected lots can be highly effective private improvements that mitigate\nthe flood risks in this area. However, the work would be on private\nproperty and therefore require special agreements (easements,\ncost-sharing, access requirements, or code updates, etc.) for the Town\nto participate in design, construction, operation, maintenance, or\nfinancing. Therefore, the town's assistance could come in the form of\ncoordinating the private efforts to ensure a comprehensive solution is\nachieved.\n\n\nQ - Stone Canyon Outfall Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDownstream of Stone Canyon Road, private development has infringed on Stone\nCanyon Drainageway.

Consideration was also given to reducing\ninfrastructure sizing and costs by incorporating detention.  Alternatives were considered first for open channel and then for piped\nsystems. Open channels are more cost effective, provide additional\necological benefits, mimic or sometimes restore the natural environment,\nbut require additional stabilization and maintenance to provide long\nterm benefits. Piped systems are far more hydraulically efficient and\nallow for more flexible land uses in and around the system, but do not\nbenefit the natural environment and can be significantly more costly to\ninstall, particularly in underlying rock soils.  For example, the development of downtown Lyons over the historic\ndrainageway has limited the ability to convey the major storm events\nthrough an open channel system. Since an open channel system is not\nfeasible, large storm drain infrastructure is needed to reduce the flood\nhazards throughout the study area. The storm drain infrastructure must\nlimit the amount of flow in the street to provide emergency vehicles\naccess during storm events.  The analysis aimed to develop stormwater solutions first within the Town\nof Lyons. When those alternatives were exhausted as cost prohibitive or\nunfeasible, then the project team considered alternatives outside of the\nTown limits. The cost of land acquisition, land use regulations, and\nextra-territorial jurisdiction can add significant costs to stormwater\nprojects outside of the Town limits. Conversely, knowing about potential\nout of town solutions to in-town risks can be prudent to future planning\nexercises in annexation, development referrals, and multi-agency\ncoordination.",

However, it is important to note that excavation in the northern end of\nthe Third Avenue basin is likely to encounter rock and other earthwork\ncomplications. Depth of inlets and storm sewers will be limited by\nexcavation cost, which limits the hydraulic head and increases pipe\nsize. As pipe size increases, depth to cover the pipe must increase and\nbecome a costly design loop to determine a feasible storm sewer\nalignment.",

Larger ponds integrated into public spaces are a\ntypical method of capturing a large water quality volume. Ordinances\nthat require water quality implementation for new and redevelopment can\nbe equally important. (See Appendix X for examples.)\n\n\n7.1 Small Scale Water Quality Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\n7.1.1 Tree Wells\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe downtown area could benefit from design of landscape and streetscape\nimprovements that incorporate water quality treatment. One example of\nthis multi-purpose streetscape is a tree-well water quality\ninstallation. Additional information is provided by the EPA\u2019s\n\n\u201cStormwater to Street Trees\u201d informational\nguide.\n \n\n\nThe tree wells have an advantage of water quality treatment in the\nhighly impervious main street area, but also have application in side\nstreet and park areas. In any case, the tree wells treat for water\nquality, but from a volumetric standpoint are a small scale solution.\n\n\n7.1.2 Rain Gardens\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAnother small scale option for targeted water quality is installation of\nrain gardens. Generally accepted as a means of treating roof top runoff\nfrom private property downspouts, there are applications for rain\ngardens in commercial and municipal applications. A commercial property\nor municipal building could route downspouts to a street side rain\ngarden, with proper consideration for saturation of soils resulting\nimpact on roadways, sidewalks, icing, and maintenance. A cul-de-sac or\nsmall parking area could be routed to an infiltration basin or rain\ngarden for additional water quality treatment. \nAdditional design and\nmaintenance information is provided by\nUDFCD.\n \n\n\n7.1.3 Rainwater Harvesting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRecent changes in state law (HB 1005) allow for private properties to\nharvest a small amount of rainwater from their rooftop for allowable\nuses (irrigation) on their property. Typically, a 55 gallon barrel or\ncistern is connected to roof downspouts to collect rainfall and\nsnowmelt. Although rooftop runoff is not the largest source of\nstormwater pollution, it can still have a beneficial impact on urban\nwater quality. The dust and wind blown litter that reaches rooftops can\nbe captured in rain water harvesting systems. More importantly, the peak\nrunoff events from the impervious surfaces are attenuated, or delayed,\nfrom entering the municipal stormwater system. \nThis reduces the volume\nof stormwater treated by downstream\nsystems.\n \n\n\n7.2 Large Scale Water Quality Improvements\n\uf0c1\n\n\n7.2.1 Confluence Area Water Quality Pond\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAt the time of this report, the ongoing confluence area and St. Vrain\nrestoration projects are making improvements in and around the rivers.\nOne area that could have an advantageous siting for a water quality pond\nis the east end of Prospect in the confluence area. If other project\ndesigns allow for a pond to be constructed in this area, the outlet\ncould be configured to treat a water quality capture volume for the\nconfluence area basin.\n\n\nThere are other water quality pond locations, but the confluence area\nwas identified as the largest potential pond with urbanized runoff. The\nexisting pond at Eagle Canyon could be studied for reconfiguration, but\nthe impervious area is relatively low in that overall basin. Large water\nquality ponds along the northern side of Town near the river would treat\nthe most urbanized stormwater runoff. However, a property and\ntopographic review of the area could not identify areas large enough to\ncapture a full water quality capture volume. Sandstone Park was the\nlargest open space parcel, but would require significant grading and\nstorm sewer installation that would significantly limit the park uses.\nOther upstream areas are available, but generally treat only the\nundeveloped portions of town.\n\n\n7.2.2 Streambank Wetlands\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are several good locations for water quality treatment along the\nSt. Vrain, particularly downstream of Lyons Valley stormwater outlet\nstructures. The side channels north and south of McConnell Drive as well\nas the Bohn Park outfall east of 2\nnd\n Avenue can treat\nstormwater runoff upstream of the St. Vrain main channel. Wetland\nplantings in a specifically designed low velocity channel can absorb\npollutants conveyed through nuisance and first flush stormwater events,\nwhile allowing larger runoff events to pass through the channel. The\nstreambank wetlands are similar to the St. Vrain restoration work\nupstream, but designed and managed on a smaller scale to adapt to the\nside tributary flows.\n\n\n7.2.3 Pervious Pavers\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe reduction of impervious area is a direct means of increasing\ninfiltration and interrupting the transmission of water borne pollutants\nin the urbanized watershed. For the Main Street and downtown areas, the\naddition of pervious pavers can be a good way to reduce impervious area.\nThere are several candidate locations in parking areas, sidewalks, plaza\nareas that could infiltrate runoff before it reaches the curb and gutter\nsystem. However, there are also many lessons learned on maintenance of\npervious pavement surfaces, specifically related to the winter\nenvironment and non-infiltrating soils of Colorado. The impact of a snow\nplow on pavers, expansion of clay soils creating ponding in pervious\nasphalt, or the freeze thaw action on pervious concrete surfaces are all\ndocumented issues. Ultimately, pervious pavement surfaces work well when\ncombined with traditional pavement surfaces for high traffic, heavy\nload, and high maintenance pathways. The UDFCD has a \ngood\nworksheet\n \ndescribing the opportunities and limitations of pervious surfaces.\n\n\n7.3 Outfall Water Quality\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is a separate category of water quality treatment that is\nparticularly suited to the Town of Lyons \u2013 outfall water quality. Given\nthe limitations on property, soils, and age of the infrastructure in\nLyons the outfall pipes discharge directly into the rivers. In many\nways, the outfall is the last option for water quality treatment in a\nparticular watershed. Other communities along Front Range have\ninvestigated these same challenges and found a few specific treatment\noptions that have unique water quality advantages. It takes a very\nunique topographic condition with a small tributary basin for these\nelements to meet a full water quality capture volume. But, in all cases,\nthe advantage of intercepting even the \u2018urban drool\u2019 nuisance flows in a\nsmall, maintainable, vegetated basin improves even the perception of a\nstandard metal culvert dribbling directly into the river.\n\n\nA list of outfall water quality options are detailed in the appendix.\nEach option is suited for different outfall locations and uses. The\ninfiltration basin concepts are essentially miniaturized infiltration\nbasins with a design suitable for curbside maintenance. Whereas the\nlevel spreaders are more complicated structures diverting low flows into\nhillside infiltration laterals that can irrigate and help sustain native\nvegetation on the stream banks. These concepts require additional design\nbased on site specific conditions, but can be a starting point for high\nvisual impact outfall improvement projects.",

However, additional information is provided here to start\nthe conversation about implementing a mechanism to fund routine\nstormwater maintenance and projects.\n\n\nStormwater fees exist in many communities along Colorado's front range,\nsome have been around for decades and others are more recently adopted.\n\n\n10.1 What is a Stormwater Utility\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe basic concept of a stormwater utility is to charge property owners\nfor the amount of impervious area on their property in return for\nproviding construction and maintenance of a stormwater system.\nImpervious area consists of manmade surfaces, which prevent the\ninfiltration of rainfall and snowmelt into the ground, and include;\nbuildings, driveways, parking lots, patios, commercial and industrial\nroads, private roads, and other \"hard\" surfaces. It can be estimated\nthat runoff from these impervious surfaces increases 2 to 3 times from\nwhat the runoff was when the parcel was undeveloped. In addition, the\nwater quality of the stormwater is worse than it was when the parcel was\nundeveloped.\n\n\nMost stormwater utilities therefore have a fee based on the amount of\nimpervious area on each parcel. This type of fee, if developed\ncorrectly, has been upheld in the courts of Colorado as a legal fee.\nUnder the Tax Payers Bill of Rights (TABOR), a utility is termed an\nenterprise and is allowed if its meets the TABOR definition of an\nenterprise. Under this definition, an enterprise is a government owned\nbusiness (similar to a water or sewer utility), which derives 90% or\nmore of its revenue from non-governmental sources.\n\n\n10.2 Stormwater Utility Fee Study Outline\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPhase A - Feasibility Study. A data collection and litmus test for\nfeasibility of the stormwater fee. This introduces the concept and\nbuilds the project team of consultants, staff, legal representatives,\nand engineers. This study results in a budget level estimate of fees\nthat could be generated from several alternative mechanisms. (i.e.\nimpervious area, rooftop area, lot size, etc.) The billing options are\nusually a key driving factor in the decision for how the fee is\nimplemented. A town with existing billing systems for water and sewer\nmay be able to easily add on a stormwater fee to the existing invoicing\nand collections systems. However, depending on billing systems or\noperational constraints, a separate invoice may need to be developed\nwith its own schedule. These initial research results will then be\ncompared to adjacent communities and discussed amongst the project team\nto determine a preferred approach. It is at this point the scope of the\nfee will be identified and limitations on how the funds can be spent\nwill be drafted. This work should take between 3 and 4 months and not\nrequire any legislative action.\n\n\nPhase B \u2013 Preliminary Plan. The initial preferences are formalized into\na preliminary plan that can be presented to staff, councils, and the\ngeneral public for review and comment. A municipal and public process\ncan revise and adjust the fees, structure, and invoicing to fit the\nneeds of the administration and general public. This preliminary plan\nwill provide a more accurate estimate of impervious area or other\nmetrics selected to quantify the fee across various properties. A\nselection of a rate structure and any classifications of properties\n(i.e. private, public, non-profit, etc.) can be made at this stage.\nBilling options will be finalized. And inherent to the more defined rate\nstructure will be a discussion on potential credits to the fee (i.e.\ninstallation of rain barrels saves 10% of the fee per year, etc.). An\nimplementation cost for new software, systems, adjustment of existing\nsystems, or migration of existing processes can be estimated. This work\ncould take as long as 6 months and may require public hearings or other\nadministrative processes to document the public process.\n\n\nPhase C \u2013 Implementation. This process finalizes the preliminary plan\nand results in the delivery of the first stormwater fee invoices to the\ncommunity. Consequently, additional public outreach is necessary. Rate\nclasses are finalized for single family, multi family, commercial,\npublic, non-profit and other criteria. A financial outlook projecting\nrevenues and expenditures should be developed to support the final\nadoption of the fee. Public works staff and consultants can be utilized\nto prioritize stormwater utility routine tasks, annual procedures,\nemergency operation allowances, and qualified special projects. A budget\nfor routine tasks may involve a monthly allocation for 12 hours of vac\ntruck time for stormwater inlet cleaning. An annual procedure may be an\ninventory of outfall conditions town-wide. Emergency operation\nallowances can be an agreement that specifies how much of the annual\nstormwater fee budget is reserved for emergency repairs and operations.\nA list of qualifications for special projects that can use the\nstormwater fee can be developed to provide guidance for staff and\nconsultants to use when calls on the stormwater fee are made for repair,\nrehabilitation or improvement of stormwater infrastructure. Before\npresentation of the fee to the legislative process, a trial run of the\nbilling, time keeping, and tracking systems should be run. In some\ncases, this can be a staged implementation where the fee is instituted\nfor public facilities at a trial rate of $1 per parcel. When those\nsystems are functional, the whole project can be presented to council\nfor adoption.\n\n\n10.3 Use of Funds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere can be specific study of how the funds are used. How the funds are\ntransferred within the Town's accounting system is important and\nincludes how the Town staff records their expenses related to\nstormwater. The funds from a stormwater utility should be used primarily\nfor projects benefitting existing development because the existing\nproperty owners pay the fees. New developers are expected to pay their\nshare of major drainage projects serving new development, because they\nare responsible for the excess stormwater their development creates. New\ndevelopments are responsible for the minor drainage infrastructure\nwithin their development such as street drainage systems, and minor\nsystem pipes and channels conveying water to the major drainage\nfacilities.\n\n\n10.4 Range of Nearby Stormwater Utility Fees\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe existing stormwater utilities in nearby communities can provide a\nrough estimate for what a fee may be in Lyons. The range is from less\nthan $1 to more than $11. Berthoud has a fee of approximately $2.50 per\nsingle family residential unit. Greeley, a much larger community, has a\nfee of just over $5 per single family unit. Loveland has a fee over $11\nand has been in existence since the early 1980s. In general, the average\naround the front range of Colorado is about $5 per single family\nresidential unit. However, the average can be misleading as the\nvariables for how the fee is paid, used, and allocated changes for every\ncommunity, land use, and sometimes by year.",

This process finalizes the preliminary plan\nand results in the delivery of the first stormwater fee invoices to the\ncommunity. Consequently, additional public outreach is necessary. Rate\nclasses are finalized for single family, multi family, commercial,\npublic, non-profit and other criteria. A financial outlook projecting\nrevenues and expenditures should be developed to support the final\nadoption of the fee. Public works staff and consultants can be utilized\nto prioritize stormwater utility routine tasks, annual procedures,\nemergency operation allowances, and qualified special projects. A budget\nfor routine tasks may involve a monthly allocation for 12 hours of vac\ntruck time for stormwater inlet cleaning. An annual procedure may be an\ninventory of outfall conditions town-wide. Emergency operation\nallowances can be an agreement that specifies how much of the annual\nstormwater fee budget is reserved for emergency repairs and operations.\nA list of qualifications for special projects that can use the\nstormwater fee can be developed to provide guidance for staff and\nconsultants to use when calls on the stormwater fee are made for repair,\nrehabilitation or improvement of stormwater infrastructure. Before\npresentation of the fee to the legislative process, a trial run of the\nbilling, time keeping, and tracking systems should be run. In some\ncases, this can be a staged implementation where the fee is instituted\nfor public facilities at a trial rate of $1 per parcel. When those\nsystems are functional, the whole project can be presented to council\nfor adoption.",

            "text": "11.0 Conclusion\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are several key concepts developed through the master plan study\nof local stormwater in the Town of Lyons.\n\n\n11.1 Hydrology\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSince the 2013 Floods, there has been a number of studies on the\nhydrology of major watersheds within the State and in particular along\nthe Front Range of Colorado. This study utilized the latest software and\nmethods to evaluate the basins immediately affecting the Town of Lyons.\nEvaluations of the minor (2 year), intermediate, and major (100 year)\nstorms were completed. Analysis of the basins included a scenario for\nwild fire, with consideration for the vegetation density and impact of\ncharred earth on stormwater runoff. This hydrologic analysis can be a\nuseful starting point for public and private studies of future\nstormwater detention, capture, conveyance, as well as redevelopment of\nTown of Lyons watersheds.\n\n\n11.2 Land Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe land use assumptions for this study determined the land use within\nthe 2016 Town boundary is effectively built out. In other words, when\ncomparing the existing impervious area with the impervious areas assumed\nby the future land use maps, the increase is less than 10% of the\nimpervious area. Therefore, this study utilized the future land use\nimpervious area for hydrologic and hydraulic computations. This is a\nunique, but not atypical, condition for a smaller front range community\nwith the topographic constraints of Lyons. Consequently, development or\nredevelopment within the Town limits will not immediately invalidate the\nconclusions of this master plan.\n\n\n11.3 Detention\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetention is a valuable means of slowing down stormwater, storing it for\na short period of time, and releasing it in a controlled manner.\nHowever, the steep slopes and land use constraints in the Town have\nlimited the feasibility of detention. Further evaluation of the\ndetention facilities contemplated in the previous (1998) master plan\nidentified several costly and complicated factors in the grading,\nstability, and available storage volume. Consequently, this master plan\ndoes not recommend significant benefit from detention facilities.\nHowever, if the Town expands into the upper elevations on the north side\nof Town development of new detention facilities should be recommended\nand carefully designed.\n\n\n11.4 Water Quality\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStormwater master plans are quick to identify the major storm water\nrisks and highlight the capital projects that can alleviate those risks.\nThe nature of benefit-cost financing decisions forces communities to\nconsider damages averted as a major element of the process. However,\nthere are incremental damages that are more difficult to quantify with\ncurrent technologies \u2013 water quality impairments for example. Therefore,\nit is prudent to consider the means and methods by which a community can\nimprove water quality in the larger watersheds in which the community\nresides. This master plan has identified a number of smaller, achievable\nwater quality improvements for the Town. The macro scale water quality\nponds that can record an official water quality capture volume are as\ndifficult to construct as the detention facilities on steep slopes in\nessentially built-out communities. Therefore, this master plan considers\nthe greatest benefit to water quality will come through private,\nsmall-scale water quality installations throughout an engaged and caring\ncommunity.\n\n\n11.5 Public Outreach\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis master plan was scoped to focus on engineering analysis to\ninvestigate the localized flood risk areas and evaluate mitigation\nalternatives. The public process was coordinated with Town staff and\nconsultants and included presentations at the Utility and Engineering\nBoard, Board of Trustees, and meetings with concerned citizens and\nneighbors. The public input to the process is essential in validating\nthe assumptions used to model the flood risks throughout areas of\ncomplicated terrain, infrastructure, and changing ground conditions due\nto flood recovery and construction projects. Given the dynamic nature of\nflood recovery projects and the current economic environment, the public\noutreach for this particular master plan must continue through at least\nthe planned completion of flood recovery projects in March 2018. At that\ntime, the regional projects and plans on the North and South St. Vrain\nRivers will be substantially completed. Evaluation and future\nimplementation of the stormwater master plan will be influenced by\ncompletion of the major river projects. The online version of the master\nincludes a \u2018click-to-comment\u2019 function that allows users to add\nstormwater master plan comments that get stored in a single database.\nThis commenting function, as well as the Town\u2019s ongoing attention to\nstormwater related matters, ensures this stormwater master plan has a\nlong shelf life.\n\n\n11.6 Operation and Maintenance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOperation and maintenance is always a key element to any stormwater\nplan. When the CIP projects reach nearly impossible budget figures, or\nwhen the priorities for other municipal infrastructure out rank surface\ndrainage improvements, or when the best projects don\u2019t get built for\nanother 10 years, the operation and maintenance of the existing system\ncontinues. The Town\u2019s existing stormwater system is functional despite\nlimited capacity and generally disconnected conveyance systems.\nTherefore, resilience to flood risks can still improve even if it is\nonly maintenance activities on the existing system. Trash removal,\ndebris clean up, sediment removal, pipe maintenance, inlet cleaning,\ngutter pan replacements, and other routine tasks are the preeminent\nrecommendation of the stormwater master plan.\n\n\n11.7 Next Steps\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe next steps for the Town of Lyons stormwater master plan include a\nfrequent and routine review of the projects, priorities, and plans set\nforth in this document. This document in and of itself cannot solve a\nstormwater problem, avert flood risk, or increase resilience in the\ncommunity. But, when this plan is paired with other planning efforts,\nincluded in development discussions, use of the technical appendices in\nevaluation of future projects, or other citations this plan can add\nvalue and clarity to stormwater management discussions in the Town of\nLyons for many years to come.",
